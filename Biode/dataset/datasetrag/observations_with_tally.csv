Like other Chenopodium species, it contains toxic compounds, such as saponins, and should not be consumed in large quantities. In some cases, it has been reported to cause skin rashes and other allergic reactions. It is not commonly used for food or medicinal purposes... 

http://www.wildflowerweb.co.uk/plant/1766/fig-leaved-goosefoot

Fig-leaved Goosefoot has a long history of human use as a food source. The leaves and young shoots are edible and can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable, similar to spinach or Swiss chard. The seeds are also edible and can be ground into a flour for baking or used as a substitute for quinoa.

In addition to its culinary uses, Fig-leaved Goosefoot has been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments. The leaves are believed to have diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties and have been used to treat kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and rheumatism. The seeds have been used to treat diarrhea and dysentery.

Fig-leaved Goosefoot is also known for its high nutritional value. The leaves and seeds are rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, including calcium, iron, and potassium. It is also a good source of antioxidants, which may help protect against chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

Fig-leaved Goosefoot is a hardy plant that can grow in a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions, from dry and arid regions to wetlands and coastal areas. It is also tolerant of salinity and can grow in saline soils. This makes it a useful plant for soil stabilization and erosion control.

In addition to its uses as food and medicine, Fig-leaved Goosefoot has also been studied for its potential as a biofuel crop. The seeds contain high levels of oil, which can be extracted and processed into biodiesel. This could be a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels and could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Fig-leaved Goosefoot is also an important plant in traditional culture and folklore. In some regions, it is believed to have protective properties and is used in amulets and charms. It has also been associated with fertility and is used in traditional fertility rituals in some cultures.

However, despite its many benefits, Fig-leaved Goosefoot can be invasive in some regions..

One interesting aspect of Fig-leaved Goosefoot is its relationship with the soil microbiome. Like many other plants, it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. These fungi form networks of threads that extend out from the roots, allowing the plant to access nutrients and water that it might not otherwise be able to reach.

Fig-leaved Goosefoot also has the ability to accumulate heavy metals in its tissues, which can make it a useful plant for phytoremediation. This process involves using plants to remove pollutants from contaminated soils, water, or air. Fig-leaved Goosefoot has been shown to be effective at removing metals such as lead, cadmium, and copper from contaminated soils, making it a potential tool for environmental cleanup.

In addition to its uses in human and animal nutrition, Fig-leaved Goosefoot has also been used for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine systems across its native range. It is believed to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been used to treat conditions such as skin infections, intestinal worms, and fever.

Modern scientific studies have confirmed some of these traditional uses of Fig-leaved Goosefoot. For example, one study found that a leaf extract of the plant exhibited significant antibacterial activity against a range of bacterial strains, including those responsible for common infections like strep throat and pneumonia.

Another study investigated the plant's potential as a treatment for diabetes. The researchers found that a seed extract of Fig-leaved Goosefoot was able to significantly lower blood glucose levels in diabetic rats, suggesting that it may have potential as a natural treatment for diabetes in humans.

Fig-leaved Goosefoot has also been used in traditional dye-making. The plant produces a yellow dye from its leaves, which has been used for centuries to color fabrics and other materials.(http://www.wildflowerweb.co.uk/plant/1766/fig-leaved-goosefoot)",113

Variable in its vegetative characters, especially the indument. A. serpyllilfolia is a tetraploid (2n=40) and probably derived from A. leptoclados (a diploid) and another closely related species (McNeill, l.c. 1967).(http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon_id=200007030)

Achyranthes aspera var. indica L.

Achyranthes indica (L.) Mill.

Perennial herb (sometimes woody and somewhat suffrutescent), occasionally flowering in the first year, 0.2-2 m, stiffly erect to subscandent or straggling and ±prostrate, simple to much-branched, stems stout to very weak, distinctly to obscurely 4-angled, striate or sulcate, subglabrous to densely tomentose, the nodes ±shrunken when dry. Leaves elliptic, oblong or oval and acute or acuminate to almost round and very obtuse, gradually or abruptly narrowed below, (2-) 3-12 (-16) x 1.3-6 cm, indumentum varying from uniformly subglabrous through subglabrous above and densely appressed-canescent below to ± densely tomentose on both surfaces; petioles of main stem leaves 3-25 mm, shortening above and below. Inflorescences at first dense, finally elongating to (5-) 8-34 (-40) cm; peduncles (0.6-)1-6(-7.5) cm. Bracts lanceolate or narrowly deltoid-lanceolate, pale or brownish-membranous, 1.75-5 (-6) mm, glabrous. Bracteoles 1.5-4.5 (-6) mm, the basal wings 1/3-1/4 (-1/2) the length of the spine and adnate to it, typically tapering off above but not rarely rounded or truncate. Perianth whitish or pale green to red or purple, segments 5, 3-7 (-10) mm, the outer longest, narrowly lanceolate to lanceolate, very acute, with a distinct midrib and 2 obscure to distinct lateral nerves, narrowly or moderately pale-margined. Stamens 5, the filaments 1.5-4.5 (-6) mm, alternating with subquadrate pseudo-staminodes. Typically the apex of the latter curves slightly inwards as a narrow, crenate or entire, often very delicate flap, while from the dorsal surface arises a fimbriate-ciliate scale extending across the width of the pseudo-staminode; not rarely, however, this is reduced to a “stag’s-horn” process at the centre of the dorsal surface, or even becomes small and filiform-or else subapical or apical so that the pseudo-staminode appears simple (this mostly in small forms of var. sicula, which has not yet been found in Pakistan). Style slender, 1-4 (-6) mm. Capsule 1-3 (-5) mm. Seed filling the capsule, cylindrical, smooth.

Edit

Lactuca, commonly known as lettuce, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus includes at least 50 species, distributed worldwide, but mainly in temperate Eurasia.

Its best-known representative is the garden lettuce (Lactuca sativa), with its many varieties. ""Wild lettuce"" commonly refers to the wild-growing relatives of common garden lettuce. Many species are common weeds. Lactuca species are diverse and take a wide variety of forms. They are annuals, biennials, perennials, or shrubs.[2] Their flower heads have yellow, blue, or white ray florets. Some species are bitter-tasting.

Most wild lettuces are xerophytes, adapted to dry habitat types. Some occur in more moist areas, such as the mountains of central Africa.[2]

Ecology

edit

Lactuca species are used as food plants by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species.

Etymology

edit

'Lactuca' is derived from Latin and means 'having milky sap'. 'Lactuca' and 'lactic' (of or relating to milk) have the same root word, 'lactis'.[20]

Distribution: Cosmopolitan, absent from the Arctic and subarctic regions of the both hemisphere.

The var. villosum is more common than the type variety. The orange to orange-red berried plants have been treated by most European authors as good species (i.e. Solanum luteum, Solanum alatum). In local populations here (at least in the material studied) there appears to be no satisfactory treatment to segregate the glandular-hairy forms with terete stems (i.e. Solanum luteum) from those with subglabrous to pubescent parts with stems ± rigid or angled (i.e. Solanum alatum).

The following specimens studied are of an intermediary nature: Dadar, Y. Nasir 6833; Kaghozi gorges, F. Schmid 2394; Sialkot, Marala Barrage, Y. & I. Nasir 7540; Hanna Lake, 1.9.1980, Farrukh & Dasti s.n. In these specimens the indument is that of Solanum alatum (appressed pubescent) along with mixed erect glandular hairs as that of Solanum luteum. One specimen (Kalapani, Hazara, Y. Nasir 6367) is dense glandular hairy as the latter, but the peduncles do not exceed the pedicel length. As earlier mentioned, hybridisation studies by Tandon and Rao (1966) & Rao, Khan & Khan (1971), have shown that the characters used for delimitation are often not clearcut. The species Solanum luteum is therefore considered here as synonymous with Solanum nigrum var. villosum Pojark.

Schoenbeck-Temesy (l.c. 10) records the occurence of Solanum olgae Pojark. from Pakistan. From the material that she cites from Pakistan, and which I have examined, it appears that these specimens are referable to the var. villosum.

Description

edit

Pinus roxburghii is a large tree reaching 30–50 metres (98–164 feet) with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft), exceptionally 3 m (10 ft). The bark is red-brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, thinner and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves are needle-like(cttp), in fascicles of three, very slender, 20–35 centimetres (8–14 inches) long, and distinctly yellowish green.

The cones are ovoid conic, 12–24 cm (4+1⁄2–9+1⁄2 in) long and 5–8 cm (2–3 in) broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy chestnut-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next year or so, or after being heated by a forest fire, to release the seeds, opening to 9–18 cm (3+1⁄2–7 in) broad. The seeds are 8–9 millimetres (5⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a 40 mm (1+1⁄2 in) wing, and are wind-dispersed.

Similar species

edit

Pinus roxburghii is closely related to P. canariensis (Canary Island pine), P. brutia (Turkish pine) and P. pinaster (maritime pine), which all share many features with it. It is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range.

Chemistry

edit

Pinus roxburghii contains large amounts of taxifolin.[3]

Distribution and habitat

edit

￼Pinus roxburghii trees in Murree, Pakistan￼P. roxburghii forest in Uttarakhand, India

The native range extends from Tibet in China and Afghanistan through Pakistan, across northern India (in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal and Bhutan, to Myanmar.[1][2] It generally occurs at lower altitudes than other pines in the Himalayas, from 500–2,000 m (1,600–6,600 ft), occasionally up to 2,300 m (7,500 ft). The other Himalayan pines are P. wallichiana (blue pine), P. bhutanica (Bhutan white pine), P. armandii (Chinese white pine), P. gerardiana (chilgoza pine), P. densata (Sikang pine) and P. kesiya (Khasi pine).

Ecology

edit

Owing to its shallow roots it is attributed to soil erosion, particularly in the Himalayas. It does not allow any vegetation to grow around it by making soil more acidic through its fallen needles.

Usually, the accumulating carpet of needles on the forest floor under these trees makes conditions unfavourable for many common plants and trees to grow. The most common trees which are able to grow in this environment are Rhododendron, banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) and trees from the family Ericaceae (known locally as eonr and lodar). This could possibly be due to the relative immunity from fire that the thick bark of these species gives them. The Himalayan nettle (Girardinia diversifolia) is another plant which seems to thrive well under this tree.

The caterpillars of the moth Batrachedra silvatica are not known from foodplants other than chir pine. The white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis), a large critically endangered heron, is known to roost in chir pine.[citation needed]

Uses

edit

Chir pine is widely planted for timber in its native area, being one of the most important trees in forestry in northern Pakistan, India and Nepal. For local building purposes, the wood of this tree is the least preferred, as it is the weakest and most prone to decay when compared with other conifers. However, in most low altitude regions, there is no other choice, except for the fact that these being tropical latitudes there are other trees at lower altitudes.

When this species of pine tree reaches a large girth, the bark forms flat patches which can be broken off in chunks of about 52 cm2 (8 sq in) by 51 mm (2 in) thick[clarify]. It has a layered structure like plywood, but the individual layers have no grain. The locals use this easily carvable bark to make useful items like lids for vessels. Blacksmiths of that region also use this bark exclusively as the fuel for their furnaces.

Old trees which die from fire or drought, undergo some metamorphosis in their wood due to the crystallization of the resin inside the heart wood. This makes the wood become brightly coloured (various shades from translucent yellow to dark red) and very aromatic with a brittle, glassy feel. This form of wood known as jhukti by the locals is very easy to ignite, since it never gets wet or waterlogged. They use it for starting fires and even for lighting, as a small piece of the wood burns for a long time (owing to the high resin content). Of all the conifer species in the area, only P. roxburghii seems to be ideal for that purpose.[citation needed]

Every autumn, the dried needles of this tree form a dense carpet on the forest floor, which the locals gather in large bundles to serve as bedding for their cattle, for the year round. The green needles are also used to make tiny hand brooms.[citation needed]

The locals of the Jaunsar-Bawar region of Uttarakhand have several uses for this tree, which is known in the local dialect as salli.

It is also occasionally used as an ornamental tree, planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas, where its heat and drought tolerance is valued.

Resin

edit

It is also tapped commercially for resin. On distillation, the resin yields an essential oil, commonly known as turpentine, and non-volatile rosin. The proportion of rosin and turpentine oil in chir pine is 75% and 22% respectively with 3% losses, etc.

The turpentine is chiefly used as a solvent in pharmaceutical preparations, perfume industry, in manufacture of synthetic pine oil, disinfectants, insecticides and denaturants. It is one of the most important basic raw materials for the synthesis of terpene chemicals which are used in a wide variety of industries such as adhesives, paper and rubber, etc.

Chir pine rosin is principally used in paper, soap, cosmetics, paint, varnish, rubber and polish industries. Besides these, other uses include manufacture of linoleum, explosives, insecticides and disinfectants, as a flux in soldering, in brewing and in mineral beneficiation as a frothing agent.

Presently, India imports resin which is far superior in quality as well as cheaper than the indigenous one. Quality of resin depends on the pinene content. Imported resin contains 75–95% pinenes, whereas chir pine resin contains only about 25% pinenes.[citation needed]

Edit

Torilis nodosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae known by the common names knotted hedgeparsley[1] and short sock-destroyer.[2] It is native to parts of Europe, especially the Mediterranean Basin and it is known elsewhere, such as North America, as an introduced species and a common weed. It grows in many types of habitat, particularly disturbed areas. It is an annual herb producing a hairy stem up to half a meter in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are each divided into several pairs of smooth-edged lance-shaped or linear leaflets. The inflorescence is a dense compound umbel of flower clusters on very short rays, often appearing like a cluster. Each flower has five petals which are unequal in size and are white with a pinkish or reddish tinge. Each greenish or pinkish fruit is about 3 millimeters long and is coated in long prickles.

List

￼Purple leaved variety.

It is a small creeping type of woodsorrel that tends to grow well in moist climates.[3] It resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, Oxalis stricta.

Description

edit

 ￼Stems with leaf stalk and side leaf (inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole are visible too) Trifoliate leaf of Oxalis corniculata

It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate(cttp) leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a clover in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like Oxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea, have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole. The flowers are small and yellow(cttp), with some having round-edged petals and others possessing sharp ends. The flowers close when direct sun is not hitting the plant, hence the name ""sleeping beauty"". Some specimen can have a single flower while others can have over 20.

 Fruits of Oxalis corniculata Pollen of Oxalis corniculata Matured seed of Oxalis corniculata Mature (brown) and immature (white) seeds of Oxalis corniculata Oxalis corniculata plant on moist soil

The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical capsule, 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) long, and noteworthy for its explosive discharge of the contained seeds, 1 mm (0.04 in) long.[4] Pollen is about 34 microns in diameter.

Distribution

edit

This species probably comes from southeastern Asia.[5] It was first described by Linnaeus in 1753[6] using specimens from Italy, and it seems to have been introduced to Italy from the east before 1500.[5] It is now cosmopolitan in its distribution and is often regarded as a weed in gardens,[7] agricultural fields, and lawns.[8]

Chloroplast genome

edit

The chloroplast genome sequence is 152,189 bp in size, and contains 131 genes. It includes a pair of 25,387 bp inverted repeats that separate a large 83,427 bp single copy region. The genome suggests that this plant is closely related to O. drummondii.[3]

Uses

edit

The leaves of woodsorrel are edible, and have a tangy taste like lemons. A drink can be made by infusing the leaves in hot water for about 10 minutes, sweetening, and then chilling.[9] The entire plant is rich in vitamin C. Any woodsorrel is safe in low dosages, but if eaten in large quantities over a length of time can inhibit calcium absorption by the body.[9]

As a hyperaccumulator of copper, it can be used for phytoremediation. The 1491 Ming Dynasty text, Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin, describes how to locate underground copper deposits by extracting trace elements of copper from the plant.

Indigenous peoples of Taiwan frequently grow this plant (known roughly as p-r-səʔ) as a cure for snakebites and scabies.[10]

Tropaeolum majus, the garden nasturtium, nasturtium,[3] Indian cress or monk's cress, is a species of flowering plant in the family Tropaeolaceae, originating in the Andes from Bolivia north to Colombia. An easily-grown annual or short-lived perennial[4] with disc-shaped leaves and brilliant yellow, orange or red flowers, it is of cultivated, probably hybrid origin.[5] It is not closely related to the genus Nasturtium (which includes watercress).

Description

edit

It is a fast-growing plant, with trailing stems growing to 0.9–1.8 m (3–6 ft). The leaves are large(cttp), nearly circular, 3 to 15 cm (1 to 6 in) in diameter, green(cttp) to glaucous green above, paler below; they are peltate(cttp), with the 5–30-cm-long petiole near the middle of the leaf(cttp), with several veins radiating to the smoothly rounded or slightly lobed margin(cttp).

The flowers are 2.5–6 cm in diameter, mildly scented,[6] with five petals(cttp), eight stamens, and a 2.5–3 cm long nectar spur at the rear; they vary from yellow to orange to red, frilled and often darker at the base of the petals. The fruit is 2 cm broad, three-segmented, each segment with a single large seed 1–1.5 cm long.[7][8]

Unique effects

edit

Nasturtium leaves, like some other species, demonstrate the lotus effect, whereby rainwater falling on the surface gathers into globular droplets which roll off the leaf, leaving it dry and clean.[9]

Das Elisabeth Linné-Phänomen, or the Elizabeth Linnæus Phenomenon, is the name given to the phenomenon of ""flashing flowers"".[10] Especially at dusk, the orange flowers may appear to emit small ""flashes"". Once believed to be an electrical phenomenon, it is today thought to be an optical reaction in the human eye caused by the contrast between the orange flowers and the surrounding green. The phenomenon is named after Elisabeth Christina von Linné, one of Carl Linnaeus's daughters, who discovered it at age 19.[11]

Etymology

edit

The species was originally called Nasturtium indicum (""Indian nasturtium"") but the plant is not related to the true Nasturtium genus.

The current genus name Tropaeolum, coined by Linnaeus, means ""little trophy"". Tropaeolum is the diminutive form of the Latin tropaeum, itself borrowed from Ancient Greek τρόπαιον : trópaion ""trophy"".

The Latin specific epithet majus means ""larger"" (the neuter form of major).[12]

￼Climbing habit

Distribution and habitat

edit

The species has become naturalized in parts of the United States (California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Virginia),[13][14] as well as parts of Europe and Asia, Africa and Australia.[13] It is listed as invasive in Hawaii and Lord Howe Island, Australia.[8]

Ecology

edit

The garden nasturtium is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the dot moth,[15] the garden carpet moth[16] and the large white or cabbage white butterfly.[17]

Cultivation

edit

￼Garden specimen in Cayucos, California

Tropaeolum majus cultivars are widely grown as easy annual plants, and will grow in poor, damp soil in full sun. The large seeds are easy to handle individually.

As they do not tolerate heavy frost, in cooler climates they are best sown under glass in heat, and planted out after all danger of frost has passed. Alternatively, as they are fast-growing, they may be sown in situ after that time.

Many flower colours are available, in the warm spectrum from cream through yellow, orange, red and maroon. Some have highly decorative marbling on the leaves.

The groups Whirlybird Series[18] and Alaska Series[19] have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[20]

Uses

edit

All of the above-ground parts of the plants are edible.[21] The flower has most often been consumed, making for an especially ornamental salad ingredient; it has a slightly peppery taste reminiscent of watercress, and is also used in stir fry. The flowers contain about 130 milligrams (0.0046 oz) vitamin C per 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz),[22] about the same amount as is contained in parsley.[23] Moreover, they contain up to 45 milligrams (0.0016 oz) of lutein per 100 grams (3.5 oz),[24] which is the highest amount found in any edible plant.[citation needed] The unripe seed pods can be harvested and dropped into spiced vinegar to become a condiment and garnish, sometimes used in place of capers.[25]

Some native South Americans used the plant medicinally, apparently due to its antibiotic (including antibacterial) properties.[26] Some Europeans ate it to treat urinary and genital infections.[26]

Prunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae, which includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution,[4] being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa,[5] There are about 340 accepted species as of March 2024.[4][6]

L.

Many members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. Prunus fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena (""stone"" or ""pit"").[7] This shell encloses the seed (or ""kernel""), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most Prunus fruit are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.[8]

Description

edit

Members of the genus are either deciduous(cttp) or evergreen. A few species have spiny stems. The leaves are simple(cttp), alternate, usually lanceolate, unlobed, and often with nectaries on the leaf stalk along with stipules. The flowers are usually white(cttp) to pink, sometimes red, with five petals(cttp) and five sepals. Numerous stamens are present(cttp). Flowers are borne singly, or in umbels of two to six or sometimes more on racemes. The fruit is a fleshy drupe (a ""prune"") with a single relatively large, hard-coated seed (a ""stone"").[9]

Etymology

edit

The Online Etymology Dictionary presents the customary derivations of plum[21] and prune[22] from Latin prūnum,[23] the plum fruit. The tree is prūnus;[24] and Pliny uses prūnus silvestris to mean the blackthorn. The word is not native Latin, but is a loan from Greek προῦνον (prounon), which is a variant of προῦμνον (proumnon),[25] origin unknown. The tree is προύμνη (proumnē).[26] Most dictionaries follow Hoffman, Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen, in making some form of the word a loan from a pre-Greek language of Asia Minor, related to Phrygian.

The first use of Prunus as a genus name was by Carl Linnaeus in Hortus Cliffortianus of 1737,[27] which went on to become Species Plantarum.

Pests and diseases

edit

￼Cherries are prone to gummosis.

Various Prunus species are winter hosts of the Damson-hop aphid, Phorodon humuli, which is destructive to hops Humulus lupulus just at the time of their maturity,[28] so plum trees should not be grown in the vicinity of hop fields.

Corking is the drying or withering of fruit tissue.[29] In stone fruit, it is often caused by a lack of boron and/or calcium.[30]

Gummosis is a nonspecific condition of stone fruits (peach, nectarine, plum, and cherry) in which gum is exuded and deposited on the bark of trees. Gum is produced in response to any type of wound – insect, mechanical injury, or disease.[31]

Apiosporina morbosa is a major fungal disease in the Northern Americas, with many urban centres running black knot fungus management programs.[32] This disease is best managed by physical removal of knot-bearing branches to prevent spore spread and immediate disposal of infected tissue.[32] Chemical treatment is not largely effective, as trees can easily be re-infected by neighbouring knots.

Laetiporus gilbertsoni (commonly sulfur shelf and chicken of the woods), is a serious cubic brown rot parasite which attacks certain species of decorative red-leaf plum trees in the genus Prunus on the Pacific coast of North America.[33][34]

Cultivation

edit

￼The development sequence of a nectarine (P. persica) over a 7.5-month period, from bud formation in early winter to fruit ripening in midsummer

The genus Prunus includes the almond, the nectarine and peach, several species of apricots, cherries, and plums, all of which have cultivars developed for commercial fruit and nut production. The almond is not a true nut; the edible part is the seed. Other species are occasionally cultivated or used for their seed and fruit.

A number of species, hybrids, and cultivars are grown as ornamental plants, usually for their profusion of flowers, sometimes for ornamental foliage and shape, and occasionally for their bark.

Because of their considerable value as both food and ornamental plants, many Prunus species have been introduced to parts of the world to which they are not native, some becoming naturalised.

The Tree of 40 Fruit has 40 varieties grafted on to one rootstock.[35][36]

Species such as blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), are grown for hedging, game cover, and other utilitarian purposes.

The wood of some species (notably black cherry) is prized as a furniture and cabinetry timber, especially in North America.

Many species produce an aromatic gum from wounds in the trunk; this is sometimes used medicinally. Other minor uses include dye production.

Pygeum, a herbal remedy containing extracts from the bark of Prunus africana, is used as to alleviate some of the discomfort caused by inflammation in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Prunus species are food plants for the larvae of many Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths).

Prunus species are included in the Tasmanian Fire Service's list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.[37]

Ornamental Prunus

edit

See also: List of Award of Garden Merit flowering cherries

Ornamentals include the group that may be collectively called ""flowering cherries"" (including sakura, the Japanese flowering cherries).

Toxicity

edit

Many species are cyanogenic; that is, they contain compounds called cyanogenic glucosides, notably amygdalin, which, on hydrolysis, yield hydrogen cyanide.[38] Although the fruits of some may be edible by humans and livestock (in addition to the ubiquitous fructivory of birds), seeds, leaves and other parts may be toxic, some highly so.[39] The plants contain no more than trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide, but on decomposition after crushing and exposure to air or on digestion, poisonous amounts may be generated. The trace amounts may give a characteristic taste (""bitter almond"") with increasing bitterness in larger quantities, less tolerable to people than to birds, which habitually feed on specific fruits.

beneficial. The bioactive compounds, polyphenols and anthocyanins, found in berries and cherries are also present in almonds.[48][47] Almonds also contain nonflavonoid and flavonoid compounds, which contribute to their antioxidant properties.[8][49][47] Flavonoids are a group of structurally related compounds that are arranged in a specific manner and can be found in all vascular plants on land. They also contribute to the antioxidant properties of almonds.[49] Some of the nonflavonoid compounds present are protocatechuic, vanillic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acids. Flavonoid compounds that can be found in the skin of the almond are flavanols, dihydroflavonols, and flavanones.[49][47]

Plums

edit

Of all of the different species of stone fruits, plums are the richest in antioxidants and phenolic compounds. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) varies within each fruit, but in plums, TAC is much higher in the skin than in the flesh of the fruit.[8][50][41]

Apricots

edit

Apricots are high in carotenoids, which play a key role in light absorption during development. Carotenoids are the pigments that give the pulp and peel of apricots and other Prunus fruits their yellow and orange colors. Moreover, it is an essential precursor for vitamin A, which is especially important for vision and the immune system in humans.[8][51] Moreover, these fruits are quite rich in phenolic substances, including catechin, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid.[51][52]

Peaches and nectarines

edit

Similar to the plum, peaches and nectarines also have higher TAC in the skin than in the flesh.[8][50] They also contain moderate levels of carotenoids and ascorbic acid.[53][50][41] Peaches and nectarines are orange and yellow in color, which can be attributed to the carotenoids present.[8](Wikipedia contributors 2025o)

Names

edit

Galium aparine is known by a variety of common names in English. They include sweetheart, hitchhikers, cleavers,[2] clivers, bedstraw, (small) goosegrass,[2] catchweed,[2] stickyweed, sticky bob,[3] stickybud, stickyback, sticky molly, robin-run-the-hedge, sticky willy,[2][4] sticky willow, stickyjack, stickeljack, grip grass, sticky grass, bobby buttons, whippysticks, and velcro plant.[5][6]

Galium is Dioscorides' name for the plant. It is derived from the Greek word for milk, because the flowers of Galium verum were used to curdle milk in cheese making.[7] Aparine is a name used by Theophrastus. It means 'clinging' or 'seizing',[7] and is derived from the Greek απαίρω apairo 'lay hold of, seize', itself coming from από 'from' + αίρω 'pull to lift'.[8]



Description

edit

Cleavers are annuals with creeping straggling stems which branch and grow along the ground and over other plants. They attach themselves with the small hooked hairs which grow out of the stems and leaves. The stems can reach up to 1.2 metres (4 ft) tall,[9] and are angular or square shaped.[10] The leaves are simple, narrowly oblanceolate to linear, and borne in whorls of six to eight.[10][11][12]

Cleavers have tiny, star-shaped, white to greenish flowers, which emerge from early spring to summer. The flowers are clustered in groups of two or three, and are borne out of the leaf axils.[13] The corolla bears 4 petals.[14] The globular fruits are burrs which grow one to three seeds clustered together; they are covered with hooked hairs which cling to animal fur and human clothing, aiding in seed dispersal.[13]

Chemistry

edit

Chemical constituents of Galium aparine include: iridoid glycosides such as asperulosidic acid and 10-deacetylasperulosidic acid;[15] asperuloside; monotropein; aucubin; alkaloids such as caffeine; flavonoids; coumarins; organic acids such as citric acid and a red dye; phenolics such as phenolic acid;[16] and anthraquinone derivatives such as the aldehyde nordamnacanthal (1,3-dihydroxy-anthraquinone-2-al).[17]



Distribution

edit

The species is native to a wide region of Europe, North Africa and Asia from Britain and the Canary Islands to Japan. It is now naturalized throughout most of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, Australia, New Zealand, some oceanic islands and scattered locations in Africa. Whether it is native to North America is a question of some debate, but it is considered to be native there in most literature.[18] It is considered a noxious weed in many places.[19][20]



Ecology

edit

The plant can be found growing in hedges and



waste places, limestone scree and as a garden weed.[21][22]

G. aparine prefers moist soils and can exist in areas with poor drainage. It reportedly flourishes in heavy soils with above-average nitrogen and phosphorus content, and prefers soils with a pH value between 5.5 and 8.0. G. aparine is often found in post-fire plant communities in the United States, likely developing from onsite seed and therefore rendering controlled burns as an ineffective means of removing G. aparine in areas where it is considered a noxious weed.[23]

Geese frequently consume the plant, hence the common names ""goosegrass"".[24] Many insects feed on it, including aphids and spittlebugs.

The anthraquinone aldehyde nordamnacanthal (1,3-dihydroxy-anthraquinone-2-al) present in G. aparine has an antifeedant activity against Spodoptera litura, the Oriental leafworm moth, a species which is considered an agricultural pest.[17] The mite Cecidophyes rouhollahi can be found on G. aparine.[25]

Toxicity

edit

For some people, contact with the plant can cause skin irritation. Although the plant's hairs are small, they can scratch more sensitive parts of the skin.[26] Numerous such scratches can resemble a rash.

Uses

edit

Culinary

edit

Galium aparine is edible. The leaves and stems of the plant can be cooked as a leaf vegetable if gathered before the fruits harden.[9] However, the numerous small hooks which cover the plant and give it its clinging nature can make it less palatable if eaten raw.[27][28] Cleavers are in the same family as coffee. The fruits of cleavers have often been dried and roasted, and then used as a coffee substitute which contains less caffeine.[10][29]


Folk medicine

edit

Poultices and washes made from cleavers were traditionally used to treat a variety of skin ailments, light wounds and burns.[30] As a pulp, it has been used to relieve venomous bites and stings.[31] To make a poultice, the entire plant is used, and applied directly to the affected area.[32] Making a tea with the dried leaves is most common.[33] It can be brewed hot or cold. For a cold infusion, steep in water and refrigerate for 24–48 hours.

Other uses

Dioscorides reported that ancient Greek shepherds would use the barbed stems of cleavers to make a ""rough sieve"", which could be used to strain milk. Carl Linnaeus later reported the same usage in Sweden, a tradition that is still practised in modern times.[30][34]

In Europe, the dried, matted foliage of the plant was once used to stuff mattresses. Several of the bedstraws were used for this purpose because the clinging hairs cause the branches to stick together, which enables the mattress filling to maintain a uniform thickness.[28][35] The roots of cleavers can be used to make a permanent red dye.[36]

Children in Britain and Ireland have historically used cleavers as a form of entertainment. The tendency for the leaves and stems to adhere to clothing is used in various forms of play, such as mock camouflage and various pranks.(Wikipedia contributors 2025c)

Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel-grass[2] or African foxtail grass; syn. Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) is a species of grass native to most of Africa, southern Asia (east to India), southern Iran, and the extreme south of Europe (Sicily).[3] Other names by which this grass is known include dhaman grass, anjan grass and koluk katai.[4][5]

Distribution

edit

African foxtail grass is native to tropical Africa, the Mediterranean region and the hotter and drier parts of Asia. It is a deep-rooted grass, tolerates drought, and will grow at altitudes of up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). It is considered a good forage grass in Africa. It prefers light soils with a high phosphorus content. As a key species for pastoralism, Cenchrus ciliaris is projected, in one simulation, to expand its overall range in East Africa under a high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5) in the future.[7]

It is also sown in Queensland, Australia and elsewhere for grazing, hay and silage.[4] It was introduced to the Sonoran Desert for erosion control and to feed livestock. In the Mexican part of the Sonoran Desert, it is still being planted and irrigated for livestock grazing. Cenchrus ciliaris has become naturalised and often an invasive species in Australia, the southwestern United States, Hawaii, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Macaronesia.[3]

As an invasive species

edit

It was introduced in the 1930s into Arizona, United States, to provide grazing. The introduction was largely unsuccessful but the grass began to appear as a weed beside highways and in cleared fields or over-grazed land. It can spread quickly and appears to increase the mortality of native plants, including grasses and even palo verdes, by taking away nearby water. This plant has a very low ignition threshold and can burn even during the peak growing season. Its flammability (injurious to neighbors) and quick regrowth allow it to compete successfully against almost all vegetation in the Sonoran Desert region.[8]

Another problem of buffelgrass in the Sonoran Desert is that it intensifies wildfires such that saguaro cacti that normally survive wildfires can erupt into flames when growing in areas taken over by the grass.[9][10]

In Queensland, Australia, the grass has also been attributed to causing a decline in the native grass species fed on by the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat,[11] and cited as a factor in the wombats' decline.[12] In South Australia, it is a declared plant under the Natural Resources Management Act and weed management activities are guided by the South Australia Buffel Grass Strategic Plan (2012–17).[13] In Australia's Northern Territory, invasive buffel grass is implicated in worsening wild fires and is declared a weed.[14][15][16](Wikipedia contributors 2025i)

Pieris, the whites or garden whites, is a widespread, now almost cosmopolitan, genus of butterflies of the family Pieridae. The highest species diversity is in the Palearctic, with a higher diversity in Europe and eastern North America than the similar and closely related Pontia. The females of many Pieris butterflies are UV reflecting, while the male wings are strongly UV absorbing due to pigments in the scales.[citation needed]

Ecology

edit

Many species of this genus have caterpillars which feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae. The chemical basis of this association with a certain plant group has been studied for over 100 years, and is now known to occur via a number of biochemical adaptations to chemicals called glucosinolates in these plants. In contrast to most other insects, Pieris caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialised that they will not eat any food without glucosinolates. The Pieris females, in turn, check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant. The crop-damaging species have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world (most recently to South America and Africa) and are considered pest insects almost everywhere. There are species of Pieris that are not pests, such as the North American species Pieris oleracea (mustard white) and Pieris virginiensis (Virginia white). These butterflies feed successfully only on specific native vegetation.[1]

Some members of Pieris are threatened by the rapid spread of some plants in the Brassicaceae, such as the way the highly invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) kills the larvae of Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis in North America. Given the large differences between the chemicals that garlic mustard creates versus those of mustards native to North America, it is likely that it is also lethal to other members of Pieris that are native to North America.[1] It is listed as a suitable food plant for the Eurasian Veined white (Pieris napi). Having not evolved with garlic mustard, the aforementioned American butterflies lay eggs on it, confusing it with their host plants due to a similar odor. Just because butterflies are members of Pieris does not mean they are all capable of feeding on the same members of Brassicaceae that other members of Pieris can feed on.[2]...(Wikipedia contributors 2024m)

http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon_id=125080

Phoenix is a genus of 14 species of palms, native to an area starting from the Canary Islands in the west, across northern and central Africa, to the extreme southeast of Europe (Crete), and continuing throughout southern Asia, from Anatolia east to southern China and Malaysia.[3] The diverse habitats they occupy include swamps, deserts, and mangrove sea coasts. Most Phoenix species originate in semi-arid regions, but usually occur near high groundwater levels, rivers, or springs. The genus is unusual among members of subfamily Coryphoideae in having pinnate, rather than palmate leaves; tribe Caryoteae also have pinnate or bipinnate leaves.[4]

The palms were more numerous and widespread in the past than they are at present.[citation needed] Some Phoenix palms have become naturalised in other parts of the world; in particular, the date palm's long history of cultivation means that escaped plants in the past have long-since become ingrained into the native ecosystems of countries far from its original range in the Middle East.

Etymology

edit

The generic name derives from φοῖνιξ (phoinix) or φοίνικος (phoinikos), the Greek word for the date palm used by Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder. It most likely referred to either the Phoenicians; Phoenix, the son of Amyntor and Cleobule in Homer's Iliad; or the phoenix, the sacred bird of Ancient Egypt.[5]

Description

edit

This genus is mostly medium to robust in size, but also includes a few dwarf species; trunks are solitary in four species, suckering and clumped in nine, of which one has a prostrate ground trunk. Many of the trunked species do not form above-ground stems for several years. The pinnate leaves, 1–6 m long, all share the common feature of metamorphosed lower-leaf segments into long, vicious spines (acanthophylls)(cttp?). The leaves have short or absent petioles and possess the rare feature among pinnate palms of induplicate (V-shaped) leaflets. The plants are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants; pollination is by both wind and insect. The flowers are inconspicuous yellowish-brown and about 1 cm wide, but grouped on conspicuous large multibranched panicles 30–90 cm long. The inflorescence emerges from a usually boat-shaped, leathery bract, forming large, pendent clusters. Phoenix fruit develops from one carpel as a berry, 1–7 cm long, yellow to red-brown or dark purple when mature, with one elongated, deeply grooved seed.

Ecology

edit

A majority of the forest palms grow under the shade of dominating forests trees along fragile hill slopes and stream courses in warm, humid conditions. The palms are found growing on a wide variety of soils, often extending to degraded forest margins in grasslands. In the tropics, most are found below 1250 m altitude. Branching of the aerial trunk is rare and is mainly induced by injury to the terminal growing bud. Flowering and fruit are regular and annual.

The reproduction is by seeds and by vegetative multiplication. Many species of Phoenix produce vegetative offshoots called bulbils from basal portions of their stems which, on rooting, develop new saplings. Close relationship among the 14 species is illustrated by the ease of hybridisation and cross-pollination.[6] Several natural hybrids were hence obtained: P. dactylifera × P. sylvestris (India), P. dactylifera × P. canariensis (Morocco, Algeria and Israel), and P. dactylifera × P. reclinata (Senegal). Phoenix species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Paysandisia archon and the Batrachedra species B. amydraula (recorded on P. dactylifera), B. arenosella and B. isochtha (feeds exclusively on Phoenix spp.). They are also hosts to the palm weevil borer Diocalandra frumenti.[7]

Uses

The fruit of P. dactylifera, the date of commerce, is large with a thick layer of fruit pulp, edible, very sweet and rich in sugar; the other species have only a thin layer of fruit pulp. The central soft part of the stem of P. rupicola, P. acaulis, and P. humilis is a rich source of starch. Palms are felled to extract this central ‘pith’ which is dried, powdered, stored and used for preparation of bread in the Indian subcontinent.[8] The P. canariensis sap is cooked to a sweet, thick syrup. P. sylvestris Roxb. is widely used in India as a source of sugar. The sugary sap from some African palms yields country liquor on fermentation (palm wine).

While P. dactylifera is grown for its edible dates, the Canary Island date palm (P. canariensis) and pygmy date palm (P. roebelenii) are widely grown as ornamental plants, but their dates are used as food for livestock and poultry. The Canary Island date palm differs from the date palm in having a stouter trunk, more leaves to the crown, more closely spaced leaflets, and deep green rather than grey-green leaves. The fruit of P. canariensis is edible, but rarely eaten by humans because of their small size and thin flesh.

The different species of the genus frequently hybridise where they grow in proximity. This can be a problem when planting P. canariensis as an ornamental plant, as the hybrid palms are aesthetically inferior and do not match the pure-bred plants when planted in avenues, etc.[citation needed]...

Fossil record

edit

A large number of fossil woods with anatomical features resembling the genus Phoenix have been excavated from Deccan Intertrappean formation in India of Maastrichtian-Danian age (65-67 my). Discovery of biocompounds from the fossil woods have affinity with the biocompounds known from modern Phoenix species.[12]

A Phoenix seed from the latest Paleocene has been excavated from the Petit Pâtis quarry in Rivecourt, France.[13](Wikipedia contributors 2024l)

P. annua

Description

edit

It has a slightly creeping, fibrous, rootstock. The stem grows from 15–25 cm (6-10 in.) high. It is slightly flattened, due to being folded rather than rolled.

The panicle is open and triangular shaped, 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 in.) long. The spikelets are stalked, awnless, 1 to 2 cm (3/8 to 3/4 in.) long when flowering, and loosely arranged on delicate paired or spreading branches. Sometimes they are tinged purple.

The vivid green leaves are short and blunt at the tips, shaped like the prow of a small canoe. They are soft and drooping. Long sheaths clasp the stem. The leaves are smooth above and below, with finely serrated edges. Occasionally the leaves are serrated transversely.

The ligule is pointed and silvery. Compared this to Common Meadowgrass Poa pratensis, which has a squared ligule, and Poa trivialis, which has a pointed, but less silvery ligule.

The leaves are smooth above and below, with finely serrated edges. Occasionally the leaves are serrated transversely.

It is in flower all year around except for severe winters. The seeds ripen and are deposited 8 months of the year. The plant grows rapidly from seed, flowering within 6 weeks, seeding and then dying.[5]

Etymology

edit

Poa is derived from the Greek name for a type of fodder grass.[6] Annua is Latin, meaning 'annual' or 'lasting a year'.[6]

Distribution and habitat

edit

It is a common weed of cultivation, known in the Americas as annual bluegrass.[7] It occurs as a common constituent of lawns, where it is also often treated as a weed, and grows on waste ground. Many golf putting greens, including the Oakmont Country Club greens, are annual bluegrass,[8] although many courses have converted to creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera).

It has appeared on King George Island in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands as an invasive species,[9] as well as on Australia's subantarctic Heard and Macquarie Islands.(Wikipedia contributors 2024m)

Greenidea [Greenideini]

Greenidea aphids are characterized by having numerous stiff hairs on the tergum (=dorsal surface) and siphunculi. Their antennae are 6-segmented. Antennal hairs are partly long, partly short, with the long ones mostly directed inwards and the short ones outwards. The fore wing has the media vein twice branched, and the radius more or less curved; the hind wing has two oblique veins. The tibiae have 4 distinct spines, and the first tarsal joint has 7 hairs. The abdominal tergum is mostly sclerotic, pale to blackish brown with many stiff hairs which nearly always have serrated, forked or branched apices. Sometimes the bases of hairs are on circular differently-coloured spots on the tergites. The siphunculi are variable in shape and length, but in apterae are always more-or-less curved outwards, narrowing to the base and to apex. In alatae the siphunculi are more cylindrical on the basal half, less curved, and attenuated and curved outwards at the apex. The siphunculi are always covered with long hairs. Aphids in subgenus Greenidea have strong transverse reticulations covering most of the length of the siphunculi; in subgenus Trichosiphum these reticulations are only at the base. The cauda is more or less semicircular with, at its apex, a style-like process which may be only a small point, but is frequently twice as long as wide at base.

Greenidea feed on the twigs and undersides of leaves of various trees. Some of the most common and widespread species seem to be mainly or entirely anholocyclic, reproducing only parthenogenetically. However, other species produce winged males and oviparae in spring and summer. Species in the subgenus Greenidea are recorded from an area reaching from southern India to Java and southern China. Subgenus Trichosiphum has a similar southern distribution to Greenidea, but goes further north, and has been recorded from near Chabarowsk in south-eastern Russia. Species in subgenus Paragreenidea are found in India, China & Taiwan. Greenidea (Trichosiphum) psidii has been introduced to North & South America. Greenidea (Greenidea) ficicola has been introduced to many parts of the world, and now has a cosmopolitan distribution.(“Greenidea (Aphids) Identification, Images, Ecology,” n.d.)

Top suggestion - Junonia lemonias

Junonia lemonias, the lemon pansy,[1][2] is a common nymphalid butterfly found in Cambodia and South Asia.[1][2] It is found in gardens, fallow land, and open wooded areas.

Description

edit

It is brown(cttp) with numerous eyespots as well as black and lemon-yellow spots(cttp) and lines on the upperside of the wings. The underside is a dull brown, with a number of wavy lines and spots in varying shades of brown and black. There is also an eyespot on the lower side of the forewing(cttp). The wet- and dry-season forms differ considerably in coloration and even shape. In the wet-season form the markings are distinct and vivid and the wing shape is a little more rounded. In the dry-season form the markings are obscure and pale especially on the underside and the wing margin is more angular and jagged. This helps it camouflage in the dried leaf litter.[3]

The lemon pansy is a very active butterfly and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very low to the ground and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the same spots.[3][4]

Life cycle

edit

Eggs

edit

Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The egg is green and barrel shaped with longitudinal ridges.

Caterpillar

edit

The caterpillar is cylindrical, uniformly thick and covered with rows of spines which are branched at the tip. It is dull black with a faint blue sheen and has dorsal stripe of a darker color. There is a distinct orange ring behind the head. The caterpillar stays on the underside of the leaf and if disturbed, rolls up and drops to the ground.[3]

Pupa

edit

Pupation takes place in dense foliage close to the ground. The pupa is compact, with small conical processes on its rough surface. The pupa is well camouflaged with varying shades of brown with fine streaks and lines.[3]

Food plants

edit

Caterpillars feed on plants from the families Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Tiliaceae and Verbenaceae. Recorded species include Alternanthera sessilis, ((Barleria cristata)), Barleria prionitis, Blechum pyramidatum, ((Cannabis sativa)), Corchorus capsularis, Dyschoriste repens, Eranthemum pulchellum, Hemigraphis schomburgkii, Hygrophila auriculata, Hygrophila costata, Hygrophila lancea, Lepidagathis formosensis, Lepidagathis incurva, Nelsonia canescens, Ophiorrhiza japonica, ((Phyla nodiflora)), Ruellia tuberosa, ((Sida rhombifolia)), and Strobilanthes formosanus.[5]

Description

edit

This section does not cite any sources. (October 2021)

These butterflies are medium to large (wingspan 40–110 mm). The ground colour is brown or grey suffused blue. Spots on the wings are orange, blue or pink and sometimes large. Many of the species can occur in several colour forms. The head is of moderate size with smooth, prominent eyes. The palpi are rather long, sharply pointed, ascending, generally convergent and scaly, sometimes more or less hairy. The antennae are of moderate length, generally with a rather short, abruptly formed club. The thorax is robust, ovate, rather sparingly clothed with hairs. The wing characters are: large, broad, variable in outline. Forewing: costa more or less arched, sometimes very strongly so; apical portion more or less produced, sometimes very prominent, with a strong projection on the hind margin at the extremity of the first discoidal nervule; hind margin always more or less dentate and emarginate, with, in many species, a considerable projection at extremity of third median nervule; inner margin nearly straight, or slightly emarginate about centre; discoidal cell generally closed by a slender nervule. Hindwing: costa strongly arched at base, and more or less so throughout; hind margin always more or less scalloped, sometimes simply rounded (without any marked projections), sometimes with a more or less elongate production of anal angle, and occasionally with a longer or shorter projection of hind margin at extremity of first median nervule; inner margins deeply grooved and entirely covering the under surface of the abdomen; discoidal cell generally open. The abdomen short, compressed, rather slender.

The larvae are rather stout, almost of equal thickness throughout, armed with strong branched spines; sometimes with two short, similar spines on head. The pupae are moderately angulated, with raised tubercles on the back, head slightly bifid. Sometimes hardly angulated, the anterior portions more rounded.

Biology

Uses and economic importance

edit

It is used as a source of nectar for bees, as forage, and as a soil improver. It is also used in folk medicine. It is poisonous to some mammals, and is a potential seed crop contaminant.[1]

In Pakistan, Melilotus indicus is called sinji, which is used as a vegetable. It has many medicinal uses. It has antioxidant properties [1]. It also has alpha-amylase inhibitory activities [2], because of which it may be useful for type 2 diabetes.

By 1907, it was in use at King Island for cattle fodder, explaining its Australian name.[7](Wikipedia contributors 2024ad)

Flora incognita - Gazania rigens 82%

Gazania rigens (syn. G. splendens), sometimes called treasure flower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is naturalised elsewhere and is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.

Description

Gazania rigens is a spreading, low-growing, half-hardy perennial, growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall and wide, with blue-grey foliage(cttp) and brilliant yellow, daisy-like composite flowerheads(cttp) throughout the summer. It is a herbaceous plant that is perennial in South Africa and in the Mediterranean regions, and annual in the gardens of colder regions. It rarely exceeds 30 cm (12 in) and forms tufts, often very abundant. Its leaves all basal, numerous, narrow and more or less lanceolate, usually entire, sometimes pennatilobed. The obverse of the leaves is shiny green, the lapel grayish white.

Like all compounds, gazania flowers in flower heads that are often taken for simple flowers. The capitula are solitary at the end of peduncles just beyond the leaves(cttp). Each capitulum is formed by a central disc(cttp) of tubular flowers, surrounded by ligulate peripheral flowers(cttp), whose color is very variable. The orange-yellow flowers are however the most numerous, often with black spots at the base of the ligules(cttp). The fruit is an achene, containing several seeds.(Wikipedia)

Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (mostly 1 mm (0.039 in) long or less), slender insects with fringed wings and unique asymmetrical mouthparts. Entomologists have described approximately 7,700 species. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.

Thrips are a functionally diverse group; many of the known species are fungivorous. A small proportion of the species are serious pests of commercially important crops. Some of these serve as vectors for over 20 viruses that cause plant disease, especially the Tospoviruses. Many flower-dwelling species bring benefits as pollinators, with some predatory thrips feeding on small insects or mites. In the right conditions, such as in greenhouses, invasive species can exponentially increase in population size and form large swarms because of a lack of natural predators coupled with their ability to reproduce asexually, making them destructive to crops. Their identification to species by standard morphological characteristics is often challenging.[Wikipedia]

Flora incognita - Lactuca serriola (84%)

Lactuca serriola, also called prickly lettuce,[2] milk thistle[2] (not to be confused with Silybum marianum, also called milk thistle), compass plant,[2] and scarole,[2] is an annual or biennial plant in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae. It has a slightly fetid odor and is commonly considered a weed of orchards, roadsides and field crops.[3] It is the closest wild relative of cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.).

will be more likely to be inherited together.[12] Lactuca serriola and B. lactucae have a gene-for-gene relationship,[14] meaning that each resistance gene in the plant is associated with a specific gene in the pathogen, with avirulence being dominant to virulence.[12] The possible combinations of these Dm genes can provide the plant with resistance to multiple strains of Bremia lactucae.[12]

Testing for the presence of new resistance factors is conducted by screening samples of L. serriola with various isolates of B. lactucae.[12] Samples of L. serriola can be found around the world with genetic diversity between populations regarding the Dm genes.[15] This genetic diversity is considered a resource for lettuce breeding because it provides a greater variety of genes to be used in response to new strains of B. lactucae, which continually emerge.[12][15] There is especially high diversity within the Mediterranean area and Southwest Asia, but L. serriola has established populations on all continents and has the most widespread distribution compared to other Lactuca species.[15]

Toxicity

edit

It can cause pulmonary emphysema in cattle feeding exclusively on the plant.[16]

Uses

edit

Lactuca serriola can be eaten as a salad, although it has something of a bitter taste. Young leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.[17] Older leaves can be steamed.[18] While unsubstantial, its roots have been used as a coffee substitute.[19]

Its presence in some ancient deposits has been linked more to its soporific properties which might suggest ritual use. The Ancient Greeks also believed its pungent juice to be a remedy against eye ulcers and Pythagoreans called the lettuce eunuch because it caused urination and relaxed sexual desire.[20] Following its accidental introduction to North America, the Navajo began to use the plant as a ceremonial emetic.[21] In the island of Crete in Greece the leaves and the tender shoots of a variety called maroula (μαρούλα) or agriomaroulo (αγριομάρουλο) are eaten boiled.[22] It is used by a growing number of Jews and Samaritans as the Maror (bitter herb) on Pesach.[citation needed]

Lactuca serriola contains lactucarium, which is the milky sap (white latex) that flows through the stem of the plant. It is used as a medicinal herb when air-dried. Although the standard definition of lactucarium requires its production from Lactuca virosa, it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from Lactuca sativa and Lactuca canadensis var. elongata, and even that lettuce-opium obtained from Lactuca serriola or Lactuca quercina was of superior quality.[23][24][25]

In culture

edit

The Egyptian god Min is associated with this species of lettuce. Also, archaeobotanical evidence in Greek archaeological contexts is scanty, although uncarbonised seeds have been retrieved from a 7th-century BC deposit in a sanctuary of Hera on Samos. It is also described by Theophrastus. In mythology, Aphrodite is said to have laid Adonis in a lettuce bed, leading to the vegetable's association with food for the dead.[26](Wikipedia)

""The Sepsidae are a family of flies, commonly called the black scavenger flies or ensign flies. Over 300 species are described worldwide.[1] They are usually found around dung or decaying plant and animal material. Many species resemble ants, having a ""waist"" and glossy black body. Many Sepsidae have a curious wing-waving habit made more apparent by dark patches at the wing end.

Many species have a very wide distribution, reflecting the coprophagous habit of most Sepsidae. Some species have been spread over large territories in association with livestock. Adult flies are found mostly on mammal excrement, including that of humans (less often on other rotting organic matter), where eggs are laid and larvae develop, and on nearby vegetation, carrion, fermenting tree sap, and shrubs and herbs.

Many Sepsidae apparently play an important biological role as decomposers of mammal and other animal excrement. Some species may have a limited hygienic importance because of their association with human feces. Others are useful tools in forensic entomology.""

""...native to western North America, from southwest Canada to the Great Plains of the United States and small areas of northern Mexico. They are the most widespread of all the New World junipers. ""(Wikipedia)

The primary uses of Rocky Mountain juniper are as an ornamental tree in landscaping. It is also used for firewood, as a herb, and for its rot resistant wood.[8]
in South Bend, Indiana.[55] This cultivar is listed by Ohio State University Extension as being resistant, but not immune, to cedar-apple rust.[56]

The cultivar 'Wichita Blue' is an all-male selection of the species. It has a conical shape, blue-green foliage, and grows slowly. It has the same winter hardiness as the species.[57]

Like most junipers, Rocky Mountain Juniper can be infected by a number funguses. Cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) produces hard stem galls in winter of up to 5 centimeters in width on susceptible junipers. These are not seriously harmful to the juniper host, but in the spring the galls produce soft, gummy horns that release spores to infect apples and related plants in the rose family where it is a much more serious disease.[58] For this reason it is frequently recommended to not plant junipers near desirable apple trees to reduce the spread of the disease. Rocky Mountain junipers are also susceptible to hawthorn rust (Gymnosporangium globosum), quince rust (Gymnosporangium clavipes), and juniper broom rust (Gymnosporangium nidus-avis). Treatment is only to trim out infection to improve the appearance of the tree as the infection is not threatening to the health of junipers.[59] In Europe it is attacked by the juniper webber moth, Dichomeris marginella.[52] The USDA plant hardiness zone range for the species is zone 3 to zone 7.[49] (Wikipedia)

Cascabela thevetia (synonym Thevetia peruviana) is a poisonous plant native throughout Mexico and in Central America, and cultivated widely as an ornamental. It is a relative of Nerium oleander, giving it a common name yellow oleander.

Description

Cascabela thevetia is an evergreen tropical shrub or small tree. Its leaves are willow-like, linear-lanceolate, and glossy green in color. They are covered in waxy coating to reduce water loss (typical of oleanders). Its stem is green turning silver/gray as it ages.[5] Flowers bloom from summer to fall. The long funnel-shaped sometimes-fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot, sometimes white) flowers are in few-flowered terminal clusters.[5] Its fruit is deep red-black in color encasing a large seed that bears some resemblance to a 'Chinese lucky nut.'[clarification needed]

Toxicity

The main toxins are the cardenolides called thevetin A and thevetin B; others include peruvoside, neriifolin, thevetoxin and ruvoside.[7][8] These cardenolides are not destroyed by drying or heating and they are very similar to digoxin from Digitalis purpurea. They produce gastric and cardiotoxic effects. Antidotes for treatment include atropine and digoxin immune fabs (antibodies) and treatment may include oral administration of activated charcoal.[9][10][11] Ovine polyclonal anti-digitoxin Fab fragment antibody (DigiTAb; Therapeutic Antibodies Inc.) can be used to treat T. peruviana poisoning, but for many countries the cost is prohibitive.[12]

A few bird species are however known to feed on them without any ill effects. These include the sunbirds, Asian koel, red-whiskered bulbul, white-browed bulbul, red-vented bulbul, brahminy myna, common myna and common grey hornbill.[13][14][15][16][17][18]

In South India and in Sri Lanka swallowing the seeds of Thevetia peruviana[19] (Kaneru කණේරු (Sinhala), Manjal arali (Tamil)) is one of the preferred methods for suicides in villages where they are grown in abundance.[20]

Extracts from C. thevetia are reported to possess antispermatogenic activity in rats.[21]

In 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported on weight loss supplements substituting Crataegus mexicana and Aleurites moluccanus for C. thevetia, following multiple hospitalizations.[22][23]

Uses

Cascabela thevetia is cultivated as an ornamental plant, and planted as large flowering shrub or small ornamental tree standards in gardens and parks in temperate climates. In frost prone areas it is container plant, in the winter season brought inside a greenhouse or as a house plant. It tolerates most soils and is drought tolerant.[5]

Biological pest control

The plant's toxins have tested in experiments for uses in biological pest control. T. peruviana seed oil was used to make a 'paint' with antifungal, antibacterial and anti-termite properties.[24] (Wikipedia)

Seeds of E. indica are edible and are sometimes used as a famine food, but yields are low.

Eleusine indica performs C4 photosynthesis and therefore can grow in hot climates and in the hotter months of the temperate zone. Its seeds germinate later in spring than most other temperate zone weeds, such as crabgrasses. Though usually considered an annual, it may survive for more than a year in climates not subject to frost.(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusine_indica)

""Diospyros malabarica, the gaub tree, Malabar ebony, black-and-white ebony or pale moon ebony, is a species of flowering tree in the family Ebenaceae that is native to the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia.

It is a long-lived, very slow-growing tree, which can reach up to 35 m in height with a black trunk up to 70 cm in diameter.[1] It is an evergreen tree with white or green flowers. The tree is found in lowland rainforests, primarily along rivers and streams.[2]

Fruit

edit

The fruits are round, and yellow when ripe. It may be somewhat often astringent, even when ripe. Its common name is derived from the coast of southwestern India, Malabar. It is the provincial tree of Ang Thong Province in Thailand.

Uses

edit

Both the bark of the tree and the unripe fruit have medicinal uses in Ayurveda. This tree was mentioned as Tinduka by Sanskrit writers.[3]

Unripe leaves and fruits were traditionally used to dye cloth black.

The wood is sometimes used in guitar and high-end furniture manufacturing for its distinctive black striped on off-white to golden beige background appearance. Trade names for timber and wooden products are ""Pale moon ebony"", ""Royal white ebony"" and ""Black and white ebony"".""

Pieridae

""The Pieridae are a large family of butterflies with about 76 genera containing about 1,100 species, mostly from tropical Africa and tropical Asia with some varieties in the more northern regions of North America and Eurasia.[1] Most pierid butterflies are white, yellow, or orange in coloration, often with black spots. The pigments that give the distinct coloring to these butterflies are derived from waste products in the body and are a characteristic of this family.[2] 

The name ""butterfly"" is believed to have originated from a member of this family, the brimstone, Gonepteryx rhamni, which was called the ""butter-coloured fly"" by early British naturalists.[2]

The sexes usually differ, often in the pattern or number of the black markings.

The larvae (caterpillars) of a few of these species, such as Pieris brassicae and Pieris rapae, commonly seen in gardens, feed on brassicas, and are notorious agricultural pests.

Males of many species exhibit gregarious mud-puddling behavior when they may imbibe salts from moist soils.[1]

Classification

edit

The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with three or four branches and rarely with five branches. The forelegs are well developed in both sexes, unlike in the Nymphalidae, and the tarsal claws are bifid, unlike in the Papilionidae.[3]

Like the Papilionidae, the Pieridae also have their pupae held at an angle by a silk girdle, but running at the first abdominal segment, unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae. But some species such as the madrone butterfly that belong to this family do not shows the presence of this abdominal silk girdle.[4]""

""...Species in this family may be heavily scaled and can be very colourful. The scale-less Entomobryidae are commonly caught in pitfall traps around the planet, and also occur in canopy faunas high up in trees (notably Entomobrya nivalis, very common throughout Europe if not the Northern Hemisphere). There are more than 1700 described species in Entomobryidae.[1][2][3][4]


Ecology

On humid mornings, many entomobryid species climb herbaceous plants to feed on pollen and the spores of fungi.[6]

Entomobryids have been found in brood galleries of bark beetles, where they are presumed to feed on fungi or act as saprophages.[7]

Some species live in intertidal habitats.[8]

Springtails of this family are prey for a range of predators, including various ground beetles, the shore bug Saldula saltatoria, lady beetle larvae,[9] ants and crab spiders.[6]""


""The Entognatha are a class of wingless(cttp) (ametabolous) arthropods, which, together with the insects, makes up the subphylum Hexapoda. Their mouthparts are entognathous, meaning that they are retracted within the head. Entognatha are apterous, meaning that they lack wings(cttp).""

""Members of the Collembola are normally less than 6 mm (0.24 in) long, have six or fewer abdominal segments, and possess a tubular appendage (the collophore or ventral tube) with reversible, sticky vesicles, projecting ventrally from the first abdominal segment.[10] It is believed to be associated with fluid uptake and balance, excretion, and orientation of the organism itself.[11] Most species have an abdominal, tail-like appendage known as a furcula (or furca). It is located on the fourth abdominal segment of collembolans and is folded beneath the body, held under tension by a small structure called the retinaculum (or tenaculum). When released, it snaps against the substrate, flinging the springtail into the air and allowing for rapid evasion and travel. All of this takes place in as little as 18 milliseconds.[12][11]

Springtails also possess the ability to reduce their body size by as much as 30% through subsequent ecdyses (moulting) if temperatures rise high enough.""

""Springtails are omnivorous, free-living organisms that prefer moist conditions. They do not directly engage in the decomposition of organic matter, but contribute to it indirectly through the fragmentation of organic matter[2] and the control of soil microbial communities.[3] The word Collembola is from the ancient Greek κόλλα kólla ""glue"" and ἔμβολος émbolos ""peg""; this name was given due to the existence of the collophore, which was previously thought to stick to surfaces to stabilize the creature.[4]""

""The Entomobryoidea are a superfamily of springtails (Collembola), tiny hexapods related to insects. In the modern sense, this group is placed in an order called Entomobryomorpha.

This superfamily contains very characteristic species of springtails. They typically possess long legs and antennae, as well as a well-developed furcula.""

""Sitophilus is a genus of weevils in the tribe Litosomini. Some species are familiar as pests of stored grain, nut, or seed. Notable pest species include the rice weevil (S. oryzae), wheat weevil (S. granarius), and maize weevil (S. zeamais).

Among the Stiophilus are species which destroy stored wheat, rice, sorghum,[2][3][4] oats, barley, rye, buckwheat,[4] peas, cottonseed, processed cereal products such as pasta, cassava,[3] and fruits such as apples.[5]
Distribution

The rice and maize weevils have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the warmer parts of the world. In Europe they are replaced by the temperate Palearctic wheat weevil.""

""Weevils are beetles belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea, known for their elongated snouts. They are usually small – less than 6 mm (1⁄4 in) in length – and herbivorous. Approximately 97,000 species of weevils are known. They belong to several families, with most of them in the family Curculionidae (the true weevils). It also includes bark beetles, which while morphologically dissimilar to other weevils in lacking the distinctive snout, is a subfamily of Curculionidae.""

""A weevil's rostrum, or elongated snout(ctp), hosts chewing mouthparts instead of the piercing mouthparts that proboscis-possessing insects are known for. The mouthparts are often used to excavate tunnels into grains.[1] In more derived weevils, the rostrum has a groove in which the weevil can fold the first segment of its antennae.

Most weevils have the ability to fly (including pest species such as the rice weevil),[2][3] though a significant number are flightless, such as the genus Otiorhynchus.

One species of weevil, Austroplatypus incompertus, exhibits eusociality, one of the few insects outside the Hymenoptera and the Isoptera to do so. ""

Phylum: Marchantiophyta

Marchantiales

""The majority of genera are characterized by the presence of (a) special stalked vertical branches called archegoniophores or carpocephala, and (b) sterile cells called elaters inside the sporangium.""

""Marchantiopsida is a class of liverworts within the phylum Marchantiophyta.[2] The species in this class are known as complex thalloid liverworts. The species in this class are widely distributed and can be found worldwide.[3] Complex oil bodies are only found in the gametophyte.[4]""

""Description

edit

Most liverworts are small, measuring from 2–20 millimetres (0.08–0.8 in) wide with individual plants less than 10 centimetres (4 in) long,[6] so they are often overlooked. The most familiar liverworts consist of a prostrate, flattened, ribbon-like or branching structure called a thallus (plant body); these liverworts are termed thallose liverworts. However, most liverworts produce flattened stems with overlapping scales or leaves in two or more ranks, the middle rank is often conspicuously different from the outer ranks; these are called leafy liverworts or scale liverworts.[7][8] ""

""Liverworts can most reliably be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses by their single-celled rhizoids.[9] Other differences are not universal for all mosses and all liverworts;[8] but the lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves in thallose species, or in leafy species the presence of deeply lobed or segmented leaves and the presence of leaves arranged in three ranks,[10][11] as well as frequent dichotomous branching, all point to the plant being a liverwort. With a few exceptions, all liverworts undergo polyplastidic meiosis, in contrast to mosses and hornworts which have monoplastidic meiosis.[12] Unlike any other embryophytes, most liverworts contain unique membrane-bound oil bodies containing isoprenoids in at least some of their cells, lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of all other plants being unenclosed.[13] The overall physical similarity of some mosses and leafy liverworts means that confirmation of the identification of some groups can be performed with certainty only with the aid of microscopy or an experienced bryologist.

Liverworts, like other bryophytes, have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, with the sporophyte dependent on the gametophyte.[13] The sporophyte of many liverworts are non-photosynthetic, but there are also several that are photosynthetic to various degrees.[14] Cells in a typical liverwort plant each contain only a single set of genetic information, so the plant's cells are haploid for the majority of its life cycle. This contrasts sharply with the pattern exhibited by nearly all animals and by vascular plants. In the more familiar seed plants, the haploid generation is represented only by the tiny pollen and the ovule, while the diploid generation is the familiar tree or other plant.[15] Another unusual feature of the liverwort life cycle is that sporophytes (i.e. the diploid body) are very short-lived, withering away not long after releasing spores.[16] In mosses, the sporophyte is more persistent and in hornworts, the sporophyte disperses spores over an extended period.""

""Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom,[2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.[4][5] Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat.""

Lynx spider (Oxyopidae) is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1870.[1] Most species make little use of webs, instead spending their lives as hunting spiders on plants. Many species frequent flowers in particular, ambushing pollinators, much as crab spiders do. They tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do, and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour.[2] 

Identification
As with many other families of spiders, the arrangement of their eyes is typical of the family and is an important aid in identifying them as members of the family. Six of the eight eyes of Oxyopid spiders are arranged in a hexagon-like pattern, more or less on a prominent hump on the front upper corner of the prosoma. The other two eyes are smaller, less conspicuous, and generally are situated in front of and below the other six. The basal parts of the chelicerae of most species are large, vertical and parallel, which combine with the bluff front end, a ""high forehead"" to the prosoma, to give most species a peculiar ""flat-faced"" appearance. ""

""Description

Most spiders in the Oxyopidae family have large spiny bristles on their legs and in many species the bristles form almost a basket-like structure that may assist in confining the prey that they grasp, and protect the spider from its struggles. Most Oxyopes and Hamataliwa species are small to medium in size. Lynx spiders, in spite of being largely ambush hunters, are very speedy runners and leapers, alert and with good vision. Oxyopidae in general rely on keen eyesight in stalking, chasing, or ambushing prey, and also in avoiding enemies. ""

Subclass: Pterygota
Order: Mantodea

""Mantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 460 genera in 33 families. The largest family is the Mantidae (""mantids""). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies(ctp) may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged(ctp) and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.

The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other more distantly related insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die...

Relationship with Humans

...In culture, literature and art

One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description...

Martial arts


￼Grandmasters of the Shaolin Temple, Shi DeRu and Shi DeYang, demonstrating the Southern Praying Mantis style of martial art

Two martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[89][90] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[91] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[90] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[90][91][92][93]...


For pest control


Naturally occurring mantis populations provide plant pest control.[102] Gardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.[103] However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They therefore have ""negligible value"" in biological control.[103]

Two species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.[104]

In 2016, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence had produced a prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis, with front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.[105]"" (Wikipedia)

Erebidae

""The family is among the largest families of moths by species count and contains a wide variety of well-known macromoth groups...

The sizes of the adults range from among the largest of all moths (>5 in (127 mm) wingspan in the black witch) to the smallest of the macromoths (0.25 in (6 mm) wingspan in some of the Micronoctuini).

The coloration of the adults spans the full range of dull, drab, and camouflaged(ctp) (e.g., Zale lunifera and litter moths) to vivid, contrasting, and colorful (e.g., Aganainae and tiger moths). The moths are found on all continents except Antarctica...

Description

Adult moths of Erebidae have quadrifid forewings and usually quadrifine hindwings, meaning that each wing includes a cubital vein that splits into four (explained further in the Classification section). The tribe Micronoctuini instead has bifine hindwings (meaning this same vein splits into two). Aside from this, adult Erebidae usually have an unscaled clypeofrons and broad forewings, and the hindwings often have patterns. Scoliopteryginae, Calpinae and some Erebinae have modified proboscises to pierce fruit skins. Lymantriinae and some Arctiina (Arctiinae) instead have a highly reduced proboscis. The overall appearance may be colourful (e.g. Arctiinae, Aganainae) or cryptic (e.g. Herminiinae).[2]

Ecology

Adults of some Erebidae pierce fruit to suck out juices (leading them to be called ""fruit-piercing moths""), and those of Calyptra can also pierce mammalian skin to suck out blood (hence ""vampire moths"").[2]

Larvae are mostly herbivorous, like most lepidopteran larvae, and different taxa prefer different plants. Lithosiini (Arctiinae) larvae are unusual in feeding on algae and lichens (hence ""lichen moths""). Most Herminiinae larvae feed on dead or withered leaves (hence ""litter moths""), rather than living leaves.[2]"" (Wikipedia)",14

Agricultural applications

edit

Creeping tick trefoil is used in agriculture similarly to the closely related Desmodium; see Desmodium#uses."" (Wikipedia)


Desmodium

""Several Desmodium species release organic compounds, aerially and into the soil, which make them useful for agriculture: Allelopathic compounds are used there via push-pull technology. For this Desmodium heterocarpon, Desmodium intortum, and Desmodium uncinatum are inter-cropped in maize and sorghum fields to suppress witchweeds, including Asiatic witchweed (Striga asiatica) and purple witchweed (S. hermonthica) and to repel Chilo partellus, a stem-boring grass moth.[3] Insects (including pests) are likewise repelled by high amounts of antixenotic allomones produced by Desmodium.

A blue dye is obtained from Desmodium incanum.

Tick-trefoils in agriculture can also be used as living mulch and as green manure, as they improve soil fertility via nitrogen fixation.

Most also make good fodder for animals including bobwhite, turkey, grouse, deer, cattle and goats.[3][4][5]

Wild-living, non-farmed deer appear to rely on Desmodium species in certain areas, particularly during the more stressful summer months.

The caterpillars of the lesser grass blue (Zizina otis) and the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator) feed on tick-trefoils."" (Wikipedia)

""Oxyopes is a genus of lynx spiders found worldwide. It includes arounds 300 species and is classified under the lynx spider family Oxyopidae.[1][2] Like other lynx spiders, they are easily recognizable by the six larger eyes arranged hexagonally on top of the head (prosoma), with the remaining smaller two eyes in front. They are also characterized by long spine-like bristles (setae) on their legs.[3] They are ambush predators, actively hunting prey by sight. Though they produce and use silk, they do not build webs to capture prey.[4]

The genus was first established in 1804 by the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille.[1] The generic name means ""keen-eyed"", from Ancient Greek ὀξύς (oxús, ""sharp"") and ὤψ (ṓps, ""eye"").[5]"" (Wikipedia)

""commonly known as: green amaranth, pigweed, Prince of Wales feather, slender amaranth, tropical green amaranth • Hindi: जंगली चौलाई jungali chaulayi • Sanskrit: तण्डुलीयः tanduliya""

""I was flipping pages of Bengal Plants to find its Bengali name, found that what was NATI centuries ago is NOTEY now and Amaranthus viridis var. fasciata has a Bengali name, BAN-NATI or TUNTUNI-NATI.""(https://efloraofindia.com/efi/amaranthus-viridis/)

""Uses

Amaranthus viridis is eaten as a boiled green or as a vegetable in many parts of the world.

In the Northeastern Indian state of Manipur, it is known as cheng-kruk; it is also eaten as a vegetable in South India, especially in Kerala, where it is known as kuppacheera കുപ്പച്ചീര. It is a common vegetable in Bengali cuisine, where it is called note shak (""shak"" means leafy vegetable). It a very common vegetable used in Odia cuisine as Saaga, namely as Kosila Saaga or Marshi Saag in rural areas.

It is also eaten as a vegetable in parts of Africa. The leaves of this plant, known as massaagu in Dhivehi, have been used in the diet of the Maldives for centuries in dishes such as mas huni. The Yoruba in West Africa name for this plant is ewe tete and is used for medicinal and spiritual purposes.

In the 19th Century A. viridus, or green amaranth was an item of food in Australia. The botanist Joseph Maiden wrote in 1889: ""It is an excellent substitute for spinach, being far superior to much of the leaves of the white beet sold for spinach in Sydney. Next to spinach it seems to be most like boiled nettle leaves, which when young are used in England, and are excellent. This amarantus should be cooked like spinach, and as it becomes more widely known, it is sure to be popular, except amongst persons who may consider it beneath their dignity to have anything to do with so common a weed.""

Green amaranth also has clusters of nutty edible seeds, which can be eaten as snacks or used in biscuits. A porridge can be made by boiling the seeds in water. Unlike other amaranths, the seeds can be easily harvested by scraping the ripe spikes of seeds between the fingers.

Amaranthus viridis is used as a medicinal herb in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, under the Sanskrit name Tanduliya.

Nutrition

Green amaranth can contain up to 38% protein by dry weight. The leaves and seeds contain lysine, an essential amino acid.""

Albersia caudata (Jacq.) Boiss.

Amaranthus gracilis Desf.

Chenopodium caudatum Jacq.

Annual herb, erect or more rarely ascending, 10-75 (-100) cm. Stem rather slender, sparingly to considerably branched, angular, glabrous or more frequently increasingly hairy upwards (especially in the inflorescence) with short or longer and rather floccose multicellular hairs. Leaves glabrous or shortly to fairly long-pilose on the lower surface of the primary and most of the venation, long-petiolate (petioles up to c. 10 cm long and the longest commonly longer than the lamina), lamina deltoid-ovate to rhomboid-oblong, 2-7 x 1.5-5.5 cm, the margins occasionally obviously sinuate, shortly cuneate to sub-truncate below, obtuse and narrowly to clearly emarginate at the tip, minutely mucronate. Flowers green, in slender, axillary or terminal, often paniculate spikes c. 2.5-12 cm long and 2-5 mm wide, or in the lower part of the stem in dense axillary clusters to c. 7 mm in diameter; male and female flowers intermixed but the latter more numerous. Bracts and bracteoles deltoid-ovate to lanceolate-ovate, whitish-membranous with a very short, pale or reddish awn formed by the excurrent green midrib, bracteoles shorter than the perianth (c. 1 mm.). Perianth segments 3, very rarely 4, those of the male flowers oblong-oval, acute, concave, c. 1.5 mm, shortly mucronate; those of the female flowers narrowly oblong to narrowly spathulate, finally 1.25-1.75 mm, minutely mucronate or not, the borders white-membranous, midrib green and often thickened above. Stigmas 2-3, short, erect or almost so. Capsule subglobose, 1.25-1.5 mm, not or slightly exceeding the perianth, indehiscent or rupturing irregularly, very strongly rugose throughout. Seed c. 1-1.25 mm, round, only slightly compressed, dark brown to black with an often paler thick border, ± shining, reticulate and with shallow scurfy verrucae on the reticulum, the verrucae with the shape of the areolae.

Type: Linnean specimen 117/15 (LINN, holotype!).

Distribution: Perhaps the most widely distributed and common species of the genus, found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and penetrating further into the temperate regions than most of the tropical species. A common weed of waste and cultivated ground in Pakistan, ascending to at least 1220 m.(http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon_id=200006991)

""...native from Mexico to South America and the Caribbean. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens throughout the world, and has become naturalized in many places.""


Taxonomy

""The genus name is in honor of Castore Durante, a fifteenth-century Italian botanist.The specific epithet erecta means ""upright"" in Latin. The plant is also known as D. repens, from the Latin for ""creeping"". The latter name was originally used to identify smaller-leaved varieties of the species.""

""Invasive potential

The plant has been identified as an invasive species in Australia, South Asia, China, South Africa, Hawaii, Fiji and French Polynesia. It has been introduced to other habitats but has not become invasive.

Properties

The leaves and unripened berries of the plant are toxic, and are confirmed to have killed dogs and cats. However, songbirds eat the fruit without ill effects. Documented cases of toxicity in humans are sparse, with many secondary sources stating that children have died from consumption of the plant. This is likely attributable to an 1895 case of presumed poisoning by Duranta erecta (formerly Duranta plumieri) in a four year-old boy in Australia.""

""Uses

Peking willow is a popular ornamental tree in northern China, and is also grown for wood production and shelterbelts there, being particularly important around the oases of the Gobi Desert, protecting agricultural land from desert winds.

""Uses

Traditional Aboriginal uses

Aboriginal Australians used several species of Melaleuca to make rafts, as roofing for shelter, bandages, and food preparation.[26] ""Bee bread"" and honey were collected from the hives of native stingless bees in melaleuca forests in the Northern Territory.[27] The Bundjalung people traditionally lived in the area of north-eastern New South Wales where Melaleuca alternifolia is endemic, and they treated skin infections by crushing the leaves of that species over skin infections then covering the area with a warm mudpack.[28]

Essential oils

Melaleuca alternifolia is notable for its essential oil, which has antifungal and antibiotic properties in vitro.[29][30] Though it is safe for topical applications,[31] tea tree oil is toxic if ingested orally.[29]

The oil is produced on a commercial scale and marketed as tea tree oil.[32] Melaleuca cajuputi is used to produce a similar oil, known as cajuput oil, which is used in Southeast Asia to treat a variety of infections and to add fragrance to food and soaps.[33]

Horticulture

Melaleucas are popular garden plants, both in Australia and other tropical areas worldwide. The first to be cultivated were grown in England from seed in 1771. Some melaleucas are commonly cultivated, grown as trees for parks and large gardens (such as Melaleuca leucadendra)[34] or as ornamentals (sometimes as Callistemon) such as M. citrina (Callistemon citrinus), M. hypericifolia and M. wilsonii.[35]""

""Willows are extensively cultivated around the world. They are used in hedges and landscaping.""

""Environment: There has been research into possibly using willows for future biofiltration of wastewater (i.e. phytoremediation and land reclamation), although this is not commercially viable. They are used for streambank stabilisation (bioengineering), slope stabilisation, soil erosion control, shelterbelt and windbreak, and wildlife habitat. Willows are often planted on the borders of streams so their interlacing roots may protect the bank against the action of the water. The roots are often larger than the stem which grows from them.

Food: Poor people at one time often ate willow catkins that had been cooked to form a mash. The inner bark can be eaten raw or cooked, as can the young leaves and underground shoots."" (Wikipedia)

""The importance of infestations depends on the scale species, the plant species and cultivar, environmental factors, and natural enemies. Populations of some scales can increase dramatically within a few months when the weather is warm, and honeydew-seeking ants protect scales from their natural enemies. Plants are not harmed by a few scales and even high populations of certain species apparently do not damage plants.""

Control

""Preserving (conserving) parasites and predators (such as by controlling pest-tending ants) may be enough to bring about gradual control of certain scales as natural enemies become more abundant...

Monitoring

Periodically check to ensure that plants have a good growing environment and are receiving appropriate cultural care. Inspect plants to determine whether female scales, nymphs, honeydew, sooty mold, or ants and other pests are present...

Cultural Control

Provide plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation, so they are more resistant to scale damage. You can prune off heavily infested twigs and branches, if they are limited to a few parts of small plants. In areas with hot summers, pruning to open up canopies can reduce populations of black scale, citricola scale, cottony cushion scale, and possibly other scales by increasing scale mortality from exposure to heat and parasites. Consider replacing problem-prone plants.""

""Altica (Neo-Latin from Greek ἁλτικός, haltikós, ""jumper"" or ""jumping"") is a large genus of flea beetles in the subfamily Galerucinae, with about 300 species, distributed nearly worldwide.[2][3] The genus is best represented in the Neotropical realm, well represented in the Nearctic and Palearctic, but occurs also in the Afrotropic, Indomalaya, and Australasia.

The species are similar to each other, small metallic blue-green-bronze beetles(ctp), often distinguished from each other only by the aedeagus.

Alticini

The adults are very small to moderately sized Chrysomelidae (i.e. among beetles in general they are on the smallish side). They are similar to other leaf beetles, but characteristically have the hindleg femora greatly enlarged. These enlarged femora allow for the springing action of these insects when disturbed. The jumping mechanism of flea beetles has been studied extensively.[4] One study looked at several species of flea beetles, including the Altica cirsicola species, and described the jumping mechanism of these beetles to be very efficient.[4] This study even applied the knowledge gained from the flea beetles to create a preliminary design for a bionic leg that can jump.[4] Flea beetles can also walk normally and fly. Many flea beetles are attractively colored; dark, shiny and often metallic colors predominate(ctp).""

Altica

""The species of Altica, both as larvae and as adults, are phytophagous, feeding on plant foliage of various food plant taxa, specific for each Altica species. Onagraceae and Rosaceae (mainly Rubus) are the dominant host plant families for Holarctic species."" (Wikipedia)",1

""Uses

The ramontchi fruit itself is about an inch thick and red ripening purple. It is very fleshy and has 6 to 10 seeds in layered carpels. The pulp is yellow or white and sweet with an acidic tang. It is eaten raw or made into jelly or jam. It can be fermented to make wine.[11]

The leaves and roots are used in herbal medicine for treatment of snakebite. The bark is believed to be effective for arthritis. Most parts of the plant are used for cough, pneumonia, and bacterial throat infection. It has also been used for diarrhoea.

In India, it is used in folk medicine to treat functional disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Its berries are edible, and the bark can be triturated (ground) with sesamum oil and then used as alignment of rheumatism. Similarly, the extract of its fruit has diuretic, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic properties (Patro et al. 2013).[12] As it contains a glucoside ('Flacourside'),[13] and 'Flacourtin' (an ester).[14]

Antimalarial compounds have been found in the aerial parts of Flacourtia indica.[15]

The tree is planted as a living fence; it was one of the species used for the Indian Inland Customs Line. The wood is used for firewood and small wooden tools such as plough handles.[11]"" (Wikipedia)

Family: Fabaceae
Subfamily: Faboidae

""The Fabaceae (/fəˈbeɪsi.iː, -ˌaɪ/) or Leguminosae,[6] commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and agriculturally important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulate leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 765 genera and nearly 20,000 known species.[7][8][9][10]

The five largest genera of the family are Astragalus (over 3,000 species), Acacia (over 1,000 species), Indigofera (around 700 species), Crotalaria (around 700 species), and Mimosa (around 400 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The c. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species.[9][11] Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and dry forests of the Americas and Africa.[12]

Recent molecular and morphological evidence supports the fact that the Fabaceae is a single monophyletic family.[13] This conclusion has been supported not only by the degree of interrelation shown by different groups within the family compared with that found among the Leguminosae and their closest relations, but also by all the recent phylogenetic studies based on DNA sequences.[14][15][16] These studies confirm that the Fabaceae are a monophyletic group that is closely related to the families Polygalaceae, Surianaceae and Quillajaceae and that they belong to the order Fabales.[17]

Along with the cereals, some fruits and tropical roots, a number of Leguminosae have been a staple human food for millennia and their use is closely related to human evolution.[18]

The family Fabaceae includes a number of plants that are common in agriculture including Glycine max (soybean), Phaseolus (beans), Pisum sativum (pea), Cicer arietinum (chickpeas), Vicia faba (broad bean), Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Arachis hypogaea (peanut), Ceratonia siliqua (carob), Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek), and Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice). A number of species are also weedy pests in different parts of the world, including Cytisus scoparius (broom), Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), Ulex europaeus (gorse), Pueraria montana (kudzu), and a number of Lupinus species...

Flowers

""Pea flower"" redirects here. For the flour produced from peas, see pea flour.

The flowers often have five generally fused sepals and five free petals. They are generally hermaphroditic and have a short hypanthium, usually cup-shaped. There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. Fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), and the flowers are usually showy to attract pollinators.

In the Caesalpinioideae, the flowers are often zygomorphic, as in Cercis, or nearly symmetrical with five equal petals, as in Bauhinia. The upper petal is the innermost one, unlike in the Faboideae. Some species, like some in the genus Senna, have asymmetric flowers, with one of the lower petals larger than the opposing one, and the style bent to one side. The calyx, corolla, or stamens can be showy in this group.

In the Mimosoideae, the flowers are actinomorphic and arranged in globose inflorescences. The petals are small and the stamens, which can be more than just 10, have long, coloured filaments, which are the showiest part of the flower. All of the flowers in an inflorescence open at once.

In the Faboideae, the flowers are zygomorphic, and have a specialized structure. The upper petal, called the banner or standard, is large and envelops the rest of the petals in bud, often reflexing when the flower blooms. The two adjacent petals, the wings, surround the two bottom petals. The two bottom petals are fused together at the apex (remaining free at the base), forming a boat-like structure called the keel. The stamens are always ten in number, and their filaments can be fused in various configurations, often in a group of nine stamens plus one separate stamen. Various genes in the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/DICHOTOMA (DICH) family are expressed in the upper (also called dorsal or adaxial) petal; in some species, such as Cadia, these genes are expressed throughout the flower, producing a radially symmetrical flower.[20]

Fruit

The ovary most typically develops into a legume. A legume is a simple dry fruit that usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name for this type of fruit is a ""pod"", although that can also be applied to a few other fruit types. A few species have evolved samarae, loments, follicles, indehiscent legumes, achenes, drupes, and berries from the basic legume fruit."" (Wikipedia)

Family: Apocynaceae
Order: Gentianales

""Apocynaceae (/əˌpɑːsəˈneɪsiˌaɪ, -siːˌiː/, from Apocynum, Greek for ""dog-away"") is a family of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, herbs, stem succulents, and vines, commonly known as the dogbane family,[1] because some taxa were used as dog poison.[when?][2] Members of the family are native to the European, Asian, African, Australian, and American tropics or subtropics, with some temperate members.[1] The former family Asclepiadaceae (now known as Asclepiadoideae) is considered a subfamily of Apocynaceae and contains 348 genera.

Many species are tall trees found in tropical forests, but some grow in tropical dry (xeric) environments. Also perennial herbs from temperate zones occur. Many of these plants have milky latex, and many species are poisonous if ingested, the family being rich in genera containing alkaloids and cardiac glycosides, those containing the latter often finding use as arrow poisons. Some genera of Apocynaceae, such as Adenium, bleed clear sap without latex when damaged, and others, such as Pachypodium, have milky latex apart from their sap.

Ecology

Several genera are preferred larval host plants for the Queen Butterfly (Danaus gilippus).[17]

Toxicity

edit

Many species of plants from the family Apocynaceae have some toxicity, with some being extremely poisonous if parts are ingested, or if they are not handled properly. Genera containing cardiac glycosides—Cerbera, Nerium, Asclepias, Cascabela, Strophanthus,[6] Acokanthera,[18] Apocynum,[19] Thevetia,[20] etc.—have therapeutic ranges, but are often associated with accidental poisonings, in many cases lethal (see below). Alkaloid-producing species like Rauvolfia serpentina, Catharanthus roseus, and Tabernanthe iboga are likewise the source of compounds with therapeutic ranges, but which have significant associated toxicities if not taken in appropriate doses and in controlled fashion. (See below)

Uses

Several members of the family Apocynaceae have had economic uses in the past. Several are sources of important natural products—pharmacologic tool compounds and drug research candidates, and in some cases actual prescription drugs. Cardiac glycosides, which affect heart function, are a ready example. Genera studied and known to contain such glycosides include Acokanthera, Apocynum, Cerbera, Nerium, Thevetia and Strophanthus. Rauvolfia serpentina (Indian snakeroot) contains the alkaloid reserpine, which has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic drug but its adverse effects limit its clinical use.[21] Catharanthus roseus yields alkaloids used in the treatment of cancer.[22][23] Tabernanthe iboga, Voacanga africana, and Tabernaemontana undulata contain the alkaloid ibogaine, which is a psychedelic drug which may help with drug addiction, but which has significant adverse effects,[24][25] with ibogaine being both cardiotoxic and neurotoxic.[26] Ajmalicine, an alkaloid found in Rauvolfia spp., Catharanthus roseus, and Mitragyna speciosa,[27][28][29] is an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure.[27]

Many genera are grown as ornamental plants, including Amsonia (bluestar),[30] Nerium (oleander),[31] Vinca (periwinkle),[32] Carissa (Natal plum),[33] Allamanda (golden trumpet),[34] Plumeria (frangipani),[35] Thevetia,[36] Mandevilla (Savannah flower),[37] and Adenium (desert-rose).[38]

In addition, the genera Landolphia, Carpodinus, and Mascarenhasia have been used as commercial sources of inferior rubber.[39] (See Congo rubber)

There are limited dietary uses of plants from this family. The flower of Echites panduratus (common name: loroco) is edible.[40] Carissa (Natal plum) produces an edible fruit, but all other parts of the plant are poisonous.[41] The genus Apocynum was reportedly used as a source of fiber by Native Americans.[42] The aromatic fruit juice from Saba comorensis (syn. Landolphia comorensis, the Bungo or Mbungo fruit) is used as a drink.[43]

Finally, ethnopharmacologic and ethnotoxicologic uses are also known. The roots of Tabernanthe iboga and certain Voacanga species have traditionally been used ceremonially as hallucinogens in Africa. The ibogaine-type alkaloids responsible for the psychoactivity of these plants have been studied with regard to the treatment of drug addiction.[24] The juice of Acokanthera species such as A. venenata and the milky juice of the Namibian Pachypodium have been used as poison for arrow tips.[44]

Many species are ornamental in gardens or as houseplants.""

Description

Growth pattern

edit

The dogbane/milkweed[2] family includes annual plants, perennial herbs, stem succulents, woody shrubs, trees, or vines.[1][3] Most exude a milky latex when cut.[4]

Leaves and stems

edit

Leaves are simple. They may appear one at a time (singly) with each occurrence on alternating sides of the stem,[3] but usually occur in pairs (and rarely in whorls).[1] When paired, they occur on opposite sides of the stem (opposite), with each pair occurring at an angle rotated 90° to the pair below it (decussate).

There is no stipule (a small leaf-like structure at the base of the leaf stem), or stipules are small and sometimes finger-like.[3]

Inflorescence and fruit

Flowers have radial symmetry (actinomorphic),[1] and are borne in heads that are cymes or racemes, or are solitary in axils.[6] They are perfect (bisexual), with a synsepalous, five-lobed calyx united into a tube at the base.[1][6] Inflorescences are terminal or axillary. Five petals are united into a tube with four or five epipetalous stamens.[1] The style head is swollen.[7] The pollen is transported in foam.[7] The ovary is usually superior, bicarpellary, and apocarpous,[1] with a common fused style and stigma. (Fig. 5. and Fig.6. in the illustration of Rhigospira quadrangularis show a typical tripartite style which divides into three zones (specialised for pollen deposition, viscin secretion, and the reception of pollen).[8]

The fruit is a drupe, a berry, a capsule, or a (frequently paired) follicle.[1] The seeds are often winged or have appendages of long silky hairs.[9]

""Ensiferans are distinguished from Caeliferans by their elongated, threadlike antennae, which are often longer than the length of their bodies(ctp) and have over 30 segments (except in the subterranean Cooloolidae family). For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as ""long-horned orthopterans"". In the families in which the males sing, the fore wings have modifications that include toothed veins and scrapers for making the noise, and the surrounding membranous areas amplify the sound. In these groups, the sound-detecting tympanal organs are located on the tibiae of the front legs.[5] The tarsi have three segments and the ovipositor is blade-like or needle-like.""

""Uses

The dark red, dense wood is used as a building material for items ranging from furniture to bridges; it is durable but is difficult to air-dry. It is also ideal as firewood.[3]

The fruits are used in making wine.

The seeds, which are edible, contain 30-54% oil, which is used as a lubricant.

The bark has a high tannin content and is used as a source of red dye to stain rattan baskets[4] and colour tapa cloth.[3]

The roots are used medicinally.[1]

The leaves are eaten in Southern Laos dipped into chili sauce.""

""Description

As a rapidly growing species, it can reach heights of up to 30 m (100 ft) and can live more than 100 years.[4] Its dense foliage provides shade and is grown just for its ornamental value(maybe ctp). At the base of the tree, the bark is rough and dark grey, becoming lighter grey and smoother higher up(maybe ctp). The wood is water resistant after being kiln-dried.[4] Because of this, it is used in railway sleepers and to install motors in wells. It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings, though it is relatively hard for carpentry.[4]

The aromatic leaves are pinkish when young, changing to a leathery, glossy dark green with a yellow midrib as they mature. The leaves are used as food for livestock, as they have good nutritional value.[7]

Syzygium cumini trees start flowering from March to April. The flowers are fragrant and small, about 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter. The fruits develop by May or June and resemble large berries; the fruit of Syzygium species is described as ""drupaceous"".[8] The fruit is oblong, ovoid. Unripe fruit looks green. As it matures, its color changes to pink, then to shining crimson red and finally to black color. A variant of the tree produces white-coloured fruit. The fruit has a combination of sweet, mildly sour, and astringent flavour and tends to colour the tongue purple.[4]""

Description

edit

Remote sedge forms grass-like clumps up to 75 cm tall by 30 cm in diameter. The stems are green, trigonous (i.e. triangular in section) and faintly serrated above the top leaf (which is, technically, the peduncle). The leaves are 30–60 cm long, v-shaped and upright, turning flat and drooping towards the tips, bright green and finely serrated. The inflorescence consists of 4–10 sessile spikes which corkscrew up the stem, typically about 5 mm long and very pale green.[6]

￼ Amaranthus spinosus
Illustration

Credit: M.Y. Saleem

Annual herb, erect or slightly decumbent, simple or much-branched and bushy, up to 1.5 m in height. Stem stout, sometimes reddish, usually branched, angular, glabrous or increasingly furnished above (especially in the inflore¬scence) with long, multicellular, flocculent hairs. Leaves glabrous, or thinly pilose on the lower surface of the primary nervation, long-petiolate (petioles up to c. 9 cm, sometimes longer than the lamina), the lamina ovate to rhomboid-ovate, elliptic, lanceolate-oblong or lanceolate, c. 1.5-12 x 0.8-6 cm, subacute or more commonly blunt or retuse at the tip with a distinct, fine, colourless mucro, cuneate or attenuate at the base; each leaf-axil bearing a pair of fine and slender to stout and compressed spines up to c. 2.5 cm long. Flowers green, in the lower part of the plant in axillary clusters 6-15 mm in diameter; towards the ends of the stem and branches the clusters are leafless and approximated to form simple or sometimes (especially the terminal) branched spikes usually up to c. 15 cm long and 1 cm wide. Lower clusters entirely female, as are the lower flowers of the spikes; upper flowers of the spikes male, mostly for the apical 1/4-2/3 of each spike. Bracts and bracteoles deltoid-ovate, pale-membranous, with an erect, pale or reddish awn formed by the excurrent green midrib; bracteoles shorter than, subequalling or little exceeding the perianth, commonly smaller than the bracts. Perianth segments 5, those of the female flowers c. 1.5-2.5 mm, narrowly oblong or spathulate-oblong, obtuse or acute, mucronulate, frequently with a greenish dorsal vitta; those of the male flowers broadly lanceolate or lanceolate-oblong, acute or acuminate, only the midrib green. Stigmas (2-) 3, flexuose or reflexed, 1-1.5 mm. Capsule ovoid-urceolate with a short inflated neck below the style base, c. 1.5 mm, regularly or irregularly circumscissile or rarely indehiscent, the lid rugulose below the neck. Seed 0.75-1 mm, compressed, black, shining, very faintly reticulate.

Type: Linnean specimen 117/27 (LINN, holotype!).

Distribution: Of presumed American origin, now a cosmopolitan weed in the warmer regions of the world and also occurring as a casual in some temperate regions; in Pakistan as elsewhere it occurs as a weed of cultivation, roadsides, waste places etc., ascending to at least 1210 m.

Amaranthus dubius Mart. ex Thell. may yet be found in, or be introduced into, Pakistan. It much resembles Amaranthus spinosus but lacks the axillary spines and has a different habit; from robust Amaranthus viridis it differs in its circum¬scissile capsule, which is much less strongly wrinkled than that of Amaranthus viridis.(http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=5&taxon_id=200006989)

Ferns

""reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers... life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase. 

The fern crown group...is estimated to have originated in the late Silurian period 423.2 million years ago,[3] but Polypodiales, the group that makes up 80% of living fern diversity, did not appear and diversify until the Cretaceous, contemporaneous with the rise of flowering plants that came to dominate the world's flora. 

Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants, and for remediating contaminated soil. They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere. Some fern species, such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides), are significant weeds worldwide. Some fern genera, such as Azolla, can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies. They also play certain roles in folklore.

Ecology:

There are four particular types of habitats that ferns are found in: moist, shady forests; crevices in rock faces, especially when sheltered from the full sun; acid wetlands including bogs and swamps; and tropical trees, where many species are epiphytes (something like a quarter to a third of all fern species).[42]

Especially the epiphytic ferns have turned out to be hosts of a huge diversity of invertebrates. It is assumed that bird's-nest ferns alone contain up to half the invertebrate biomass within a hectare of rainforest canopy.[43]

Many ferns depend on associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Many ferns grow only within specific pH ranges; for instance, the climbing fern (Lygodium palmatum) of eastern North America will grow only in moist, intensely acid soils, while the bulblet bladder fern (Cystopteris bulbifera), with an overlapping range, is found only on limestone.

The spores are rich in lipids, protein and calories, so some vertebrates eat these. The European woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) has been found to eat the spores of Culcita macrocarpa, and the bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina) and the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) also eat fern spores.""

It is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and has been introduced throughout the tropics.[1][3] It is now quite common in rural areas of India.

Martynia is used for making beads and ornaments,[1] and has a history of folk medicine uses in the Indian subcontinent.[4]

Description

edit

￼Hairy stem and branches with immature fruits of Martynia annua￼Martynia annua dried fruits￼Developing Martynia annua and ripened black fruits, showing ""cat's claw"" tips

Martynia is an erect, somewhat shrubby annual plant about 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall, covered with glandular hairs, and has ovate, mucilaginous leaves 8–20 centimetres (3.1–7.9 in) wide and 6–19 centimetres (2.4–7.5 in) long.[4] The leaves are opposite, and have red petioles. They resemble sticky rhubarb. Its flowers are pale pink and tubular, and have nectar guides and purple spots. Fruits become blackened when ripe and have hooked spines at the tip, lending its name ""cat's claw"" or ""tiger's claw"".[4] They stick to animal fur and eventually the seeds fall out as the fruit gets crushed by the animal's feet.

Taxonomy

edit

The genus and species were first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 publication, Species Plantarum, although the modern taxonomic definition may not correspond with the original Linnaeus description, instead being a synonym for Proboscidea louisianica (Miller) Thellung,[5] as well as other names used in India.[4]

Martynia was collected by the Scottish naval surgeon William Houstoun near Veracruz, Mexico.[citation needed] Houstoun sent seeds of this new plant to Philip Miller, chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden, in 1731. Houstoun named the plant, Martynia, in honor of a professor of botany at Cambridge, John Martyn. The plant was described in Martyn's work Historia Plantarum Rariorum, with a full description and illustration.[citation needed]

Martyn gave the species the following descriptive name: Martynia annua villosa et viscosa, folio subrotundo, flore magno rubro.[5] In India, it has several taxonomic synonyms and common names.[4]

Distribution

edit

Martynia is widely naturalized across subtropical and tropical world regions, particularly in Central America and the Indian subcontinent.[1][4] It is typically found in uncultivated fields and arable lands from plains to 1,500 metres (4,900 ft).[4]

Uses

edit

The plant is used for making beads and other native ornaments.[1] It has been applied for numerous supposed treatments in Ayurveda and Siddha folk medicine.[4]

Edit

Mallotus philippensis is a plant in the spurge family. It is known as the kamala tree or red kamala or kumkum tree, due to the fruit covering, which produces a red dye. However, it must be distinguished from kamala meaning ""lotus"" in many Indian languages, an unrelated plant, flower, and sometimes metonymic spiritual or artistic concept. Mallotus philippensis has many other local names. This kamala often appears in rainforest margins. Or in disturbed areas free from fire, in moderate to high rainfall areas.

It occurs in South Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as Afghanistan and Australia. The southernmost limit of natural distribution is Mount Keira, south of Sydney. The species name refers to the type specimen being collected in the Philippines, where it is known as banato.

Description

edit

A bush to small or medium-sized tree, up to 25 metres tall and a trunk diameter of 40 cm. The trunk is fluted and irregular at the base. The grey bark is smooth, or with occasional wrinkles or corky bumps. Small branches are greyish brown in colour, with rusty covered small hairs towards the end. Leaf scars evident.

Leaves are opposite on the stem, ovate to oblong in shape. 4 to 12 cm long, 2 to 7 cm wide with a long pointed tip. The upper surface is green without hairs, the underside pale grey in colour. With a magnifying glass, small red glands may be visible. Leaf stems 2 to 5 cm long, somewhat thickened at both ends. The first leaf vein on either side of the mid rib extends from the leaf base, to over half the length of the leaf. Veins raised and evident under the leaf.

Flowers, fruit and regeneration

edit

Yellow-brown flowers form on racemes. Racemes up to 6 cm long. Male and female flowers grow on separate trees. New South Wales flowering period is from June to November. Flowering period in the Philippines is March to April. Fruit may appear at any time of the year, three months or so after flowering. Usually a three lobed capsule, 6 to 9 mm broad, covered in red powdery substance. This is soluble in alcohol, which produces a golden red dye suited to colouring of silk and wool.[1] One small black globular seed in each of the three parts of the capsule, seeds 2 to 3 mm in diameter.

Fresh seed is advised for germination.

It is a moderately growing tree.[2]

Uses

edit

Mallotus philippensis is used to produce yellow dye and herbal remedies.[3] It produces rottlerin, a potent large conductance potassium channel opener.[citation needed]

""Blattella is a genus of cosmopolitan and wild cockroaches in the family Ectobiidae.[1] ""

""Ectobiidae (formerly Blattellidae)[1][2] is a family of the order Blattodea (cockroaches). This family contains many of the smaller common household pest cockroaches, among others.""

""his group of insects are nocturnal, only foraging for food and water at night. ""

""The cockroach is flattened dorsolaterally(ctp) and is roughly oval with a shield-like plate, the pronotum, covering its thorax and posterior region of the head. The antennae are many-segmented, long and slender, and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The forewings are normally leathery and the hind wings membranous. The coxae of the legs are flattened to enable the femurs to fit neatly against them when folded.""

Nerium oleander (/ˈnɪəriəm ... / NEER-ee-əm),[2] commonly known as oleander or rosebay,[3] is a shrub or small tree cultivated worldwide in temperate and subtropical areas as an ornamental and landscaping plant. It is the only species currently classified in the genus Nerium, belonging to subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. It is so widely cultivated that no precise region of origin has been identified, though it is usually associated with the Mediterranean Basin.

Distribution and habitat

edit

￼A wadi in Libya

Nerium oleander is either native or naturalized to a broad area spanning from Northwest Africa and Iberian and Italian Peninsula eastward through the Mediterranean region and warmer areas of the Black Sea region, Arabian Peninsula, southern Asia, and as far east as Yunnan in southern parts of China.[15][16][17][18] ...(Wikipedia contributors 2025s)

The Rhesus Macaque, also commonly referred to as the Rhesus Monkey, are one of the more widely known of the Old World Monkeys (Rhesus, 2010). They are scientifically known as the Macaca mulatta, part of the Cercopithecidae family (Rhesus, 2010).
Habitat & Geographic Range
The Rhesus Macaques are the only species of the Old World Monkeys that reside outside of Africa. Their geographic range includes Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, India, and Southeast Asia (Rhesus, 2010). Their habitat varies greatly, as they can live in many rural and occasionally in urban environments. Rhesus Macaques can typically be found residing in mountainous regions (up to 2500m), woodlands, and grasslands (Macaque, n.d.). Some Rhesus Monkeys can also be found living among human communities, especially in India where they are regarded as sacred (Rhesus, 2010). Macaques, although a small troop, are now roaming in the wild in Florida. They were first introduced Silver Springs State Park in 1930s, and are now living successfully due to their highly adaptable nature (Jervis, 2017).
Size /Weight & Lifespan
Males of this species are the dominant sex; therefore, they are typically larger. Males are normally 53 centimetres tall and 7.7 kilograms heavy (Macaque, n.d.). Females are normally 47 centimetres tall and 5.3 kilograms heavy. In captivity, females tend to live 20 to 25 years, whereas males tend to live 15 to 20. However, in the wild they rarely live beyond an average of 15 years of age for both the sexes (Macaque, n.d.).
Diet
The Rhesus Macaques are an omnivorous species. They are typically known to feed on leaves, roots, pine needles, and rarely insects and small animals (Macaque, n.d.). As they have a large geographical range, their feeding behaviour varies. On average, they are 45% of the activity they participate in involves foraging and feeding (Goldstein and Richard, 1989). The Macaques that reside in the Margalla Hills are studied to predominantly feed on herbs, grass, clovers, etc. Majority of the Macaques species has a high amount of fruit in their diet, but interestingly the Margalla Hills Macaques do not incorporate much fruit into their diet (Goldstein and Richard, 1989). 
Reproduction & Communication
Female Rhesus Macaques reach sexual maturity at age 3 and males at age 4 (Macaque, n.d.). They live in troops/societies with an average of 20 individuals. Females tend to follow a menstrual cycle similar to that of humans, and product one child every year (Bercovitch, 1997). Dominant males tend not to stay with the troop, only coming in contact during mating season. Less dominant males are shown to consort, and stick with the troop. Males of the species have not been observed to compete with one another during mating season, and females do not show preference for a specific phenotypical trait (Bercovitch, 1997). Studies show that reproductive success and output is influenced by feeding behaviour for both males and females (Bercovitch, 1997). The child is raised in a social environment where the burden is not only on the mother.
Since the Rhesus Monkey lives in a society of an average of 20 troops, communication is vital. A study conducted by Marc Hauser and Peter Marler discovered five acoustically distinguishable calls made by Macaques (Hauser and Marler, 1993). Three of these vocalizations are associated with the discovery of rare and preferred foods. The other two vocalizations can be associated with food and non-food contexts - they can be used for social grooming and/or interaction between mother and child (Hauser and Marler, 1993). 
Macaques are also able to vocalize five different classes of screams during agonistic encounters (Gouzoules et al., 1984). Each scream is associated with the level of the opponent they are facing the level of physical aggression. These screams are studied to be an indicator to allies (other troop members) of the danger and requirement of help (Gouzoules et al., 1984).
Predation: Does the animal have any predators?
The species do not have many predators. Leopards and bears are the two main predators of the Rhesus Monkeys; however, these two species are not very abundant and are referred to as endangered (Macaque, n.d.). Due to this, the Macaques do not encounter predators very often.
Conservation Status
The Rhesus Macaques have a safe conservation status of Least Concerned (Rhesus, 2010). This means they are not endangered, near-threatened, or dependant upon conservation. Their population trend is unknown as of now, but is nothing the UN is worried about (Rhesus, 2010).
Did you know? 
The first primate astronaut, Albert, who preceded humans into space was a Rhesus Macaque (Rhesus, 2010).
They enjoy swimming and are known to form move to urban areas to obtain food from humans (Macaque, n.d.).
