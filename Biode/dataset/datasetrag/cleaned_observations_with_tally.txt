The observation (ID: 247077528) is documented with an image available at https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/441212397/square.jpeg. Notes: Id: inaturalist - pretty sure Sitophilus

"Sitophilus is a genus of weevils in the tribe Litosomini. Some species are familiar as pests of stored grain, nut, or seed. Notable pest species include the rice weevil (S. oryzae), wheat weevil (S. granarius), and maize weevil (S. zeamais).

Among the Stiophilus are species which destroy stored wheat, rice, sorghum,[2][3][4] oats, barley, rye, buckwheat,[4] peas, cottonseed, processed cereal products such as pasta, cassava,[3] and fruits such as apples.[5]
Distribution

The rice and maize weevils have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the warmer parts of the world. In Europe they are replaced by the temperate Palearctic wheat weevil."

"Weevils are beetles belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea, known for their elongated snouts. They are usually small – less than 6 mm (1⁄4 in) in length – and herbivorous. Approximately 97,000 species of weevils are known. They belong to several families, with most of them in the family Curculionidae (the true weevils). It also includes bark beetles, which while morphologically dissimilar to other weevils in lacking the distinctive snout, is a subfamily of Curculionidae."

"A weevil's rostrum, or elongated snout(ctp), hosts chewing mouthparts instead of the piercing mouthparts that proboscis-possessing insects are known for. The mouthparts are often used to excavate tunnels into grains.[1] In more derived weevils, the rostrum has a groove in which the weevil can fold the first segment of its antennae.

Most weevils have the ability to fly (including pest species such as the rice weevil),[2][3] though a significant number are flightless, such as the genus Otiorhynchus.

One species of weevil, Austroplatypus incompertus, exhibits eusociality, one of the few insects outside the Hymenoptera and the Isoptera to do so. "

Ambrosia artemisiifolia is an annual plant that emerges in late spring. It propagates mainly by rhizomes,[clarification needed] but also by seed.[4]

It is much-branched, and grows up to 70 centimetres (2.3 ft) in height.[9] The pinnately divided soft and hairy leaves are 3–12 centimetres (1.2–4.7 in) long.[9]

Its bloom period is July to October in North America.[9] Its pollen is wind-dispersed, and can be a strong allergen to people with hay fever.[4][10]

It produces 2–4 mm obconic green to brown fruit(ctp).[9] It sets seed in later summer or autumn(ctp)."

Phylum: Marchantiophyta

Marchantiales

"The majority of genera are characterized by the presence of (a) special stalked vertical branches called archegoniophores or carpocephala, and (b) sterile cells called elaters inside the sporangium."

"Marchantiopsida is a class of liverworts within the phylum Marchantiophyta.[2] The species in this class are known as complex thalloid liverworts. The species in this class are widely distributed and can be found worldwide.[3] Complex oil bodies are only found in the gametophyte.[4]"

"Description

edit

Most liverworts are small, measuring from 2–20 millimetres (0.08–0.8 in) wide with individual plants less than 10 centimetres (4 in) long,[6] so they are often overlooked. The most familiar liverworts consist of a prostrate, flattened, ribbon-like or branching structure called a thallus (plant body); these liverworts are termed thallose liverworts. However, most liverworts produce flattened stems with overlapping scales or leaves in two or more ranks, the middle rank is often conspicuously different from the outer ranks; these are called leafy liverworts or scale liverworts.[7][8] "

"Liverworts can most reliably be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses by their single-celled rhizoids.[9] Other differences are not universal for all mosses and all liverworts;[8] but the lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves in thallose species, or in leafy species the presence of deeply lobed or segmented leaves and the presence of leaves arranged in three ranks,[10][11] as well as frequent dichotomous branching, all point to the plant being a liverwort. With a few exceptions, all liverworts undergo polyplastidic meiosis, in contrast to mosses and hornworts which have monoplastidic meiosis.[12] Unlike any other embryophytes, most liverworts contain unique membrane-bound oil bodies containing isoprenoids in at least some of their cells, lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of all other plants being unenclosed.[13] The overall physical similarity of some mosses and leafy liverworts means that confirmation of the identification of some groups can be performed with certainty only with the aid of microscopy or an experienced bryologist.

Liverworts, like other bryophytes, have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, with the sporophyte dependent on the gametophyte.[13] The sporophyte of many liverworts are non-photosynthetic, but there are also several that are photosynthetic to various degrees.[14] Cells in a typical liverwort plant each contain only a single set of genetic information, so the plant's cells are haploid for the majority of its life cycle. This contrasts sharply with the pattern exhibited by nearly all animals and by vascular plants. In the more familiar seed plants, the haploid generation is represented only by the tiny pollen and the ovule, while the diploid generation is the familiar tree or other plant.[15] Another unusual feature of the liverwort life cycle is that sporophytes (i.e. the diploid body) are very short-lived, withering away not long after releasing spores.[16] In mosses, the sporophyte is more persistent and in hornworts, the sporophyte disperses spores over an extended period."

The observation (ID: 246727647) is documented with an image available at https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/440522454/square.jpeg. Notes: Id: inaturalist Oxyopidae

"Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom,[2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.[4][5] Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat."

Lynx spider (Oxyopidae) is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1870.[1] Most species make little use of webs, instead spending their lives as hunting spiders on plants. Many species frequent flowers in particular, ambushing pollinators, much as crab spiders do. They tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do, and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour.[2] 

Identification
As with many other families of spiders, the arrangement of their eyes is typical of the family and is an important aid in identifying them as members of the family. Six of the eight eyes of Oxyopid spiders are arranged in a hexagon-like pattern, more or less on a prominent hump on the front upper corner of the prosoma. The other two eyes are smaller, less conspicuous, and generally are situated in front of and below the other six. The basal parts of the chelicerae of most species are large, vertical and parallel, which combine with the bluff front end, a "high forehead" to the prosoma, to give most species a peculiar "flat-faced" appearance. "

"Description

Most spiders in the Oxyopidae family have large spiny bristles on their legs and in many species the bristles form almost a basket-like structure that may assist in confining the prey that they grasp, and protect the spider from its struggles. Most Oxyopes and Hamataliwa species are small to medium in size. Lynx spiders, in spite of being largely ambush hunters, are very speedy runners and leapers, alert and with good vision. Oxyopidae in general rely on keen eyesight in stalking, chasing, or ambushing prey, and also in avoiding enemies. "

Subclass: Pterygota
Order: Mantodea

"Mantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 460 genera in 33 families. The largest family is the Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies(ctp) may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged(ctp) and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.

The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other more distantly related insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die...

Relationship with Humans

...In culture, literature and art

One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description...

Martial arts


￼Grandmasters of the Shaolin Temple, Shi DeRu and Shi DeYang, demonstrating the Southern Praying Mantis style of martial art

Two martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[89][90] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[91] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[90] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[90][91][92][93]...


For pest control


Naturally occurring mantis populations provide plant pest control.[102] Gardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.[103] However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They therefore have "negligible value" in biological control.[103]

Two species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.[104]

Robotics

Further information: Biomimicry

In 2016, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence had produced a prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis, with front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.[105]" (Wikipedia)

"Noctuoidea is the superfamily of noctuid (Latin "night owl") or "owlet" moths, and has more than 70,000 described species, the largest number of any Lepidopteran superfamily."

Erebidae

"The family is among the largest families of moths by species count and contains a wide variety of well-known macromoth groups...

The sizes of the adults range from among the largest of all moths (>5 in (127 mm) wingspan in the black witch) to the smallest of the macromoths (0.25 in (6 mm) wingspan in some of the Micronoctuini).

The coloration of the adults spans the full range of dull, drab, and camouflaged(ctp) (e.g., Zale lunifera and litter moths) to vivid, contrasting, and colorful (e.g., Aganainae and tiger moths). The moths are found on all continents except Antarctica...

Description

Adult moths of Erebidae have quadrifid forewings and usually quadrifine hindwings, meaning that each wing includes a cubital vein that splits into four (explained further in the Classification section). The tribe Micronoctuini instead has bifine hindwings (meaning this same vein splits into two). Aside from this, adult Erebidae usually have an unscaled clypeofrons and broad forewings, and the hindwings often have patterns. Scoliopteryginae, Calpinae and some Erebinae have modified proboscises to pierce fruit skins. Lymantriinae and some Arctiina (Arctiinae) instead have a highly reduced proboscis. The overall appearance may be colourful (e.g. Arctiinae, Aganainae) or cryptic (e.g. Herminiinae).[2]

Ecology

Adults of some Erebidae pierce fruit to suck out juices (leading them to be called "fruit-piercing moths"), and those of Calyptra can also pierce mammalian skin to suck out blood (hence "vampire moths").[2]

Larvae are mostly herbivorous, like most lepidopteran larvae, and different taxa prefer different plants. Lithosiini (Arctiinae) larvae are unusual in feeding on algae and lichens (hence "lichen moths"). Most Herminiinae larvae feed on dead or withered leaves (hence "litter moths"), rather than living leaves.[2]" (Wikipedia).

"Oxyopes is a genus of lynx spiders found worldwide. It includes arounds 300 species and is classified under the lynx spider family Oxyopidae.[1][2] Like other lynx spiders, they are easily recognizable by the six larger eyes arranged hexagonally on top of the head (prosoma), with the remaining smaller two eyes in front. They are also characterized by long spine-like bristles (setae) on their legs.[3] They are ambush predators, actively hunting prey by sight. Though they produce and use silk, they do not build webs to capture prey.[4]

The genus was first established in 1804 by the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille.[1] The generic name means "keen-eyed", from Ancient Greek ὀξύς (oxús, "sharp") and ὤψ (ṓps, "eye").[5]" (Wikipedia)

"Chrysomya’s primary importance to the field of medico-criminal forensic entomology is due to the genus’ reliable life cycle, allowing investigators to accurately develop a postmortem interval. Chrysomya adults are typically metallic colored with thick setae on the meron and plumose arista. The name comes from the word chrysos, meaning “golden” in reference to the metallic sheen of the genus’ species, and -mya, a derivation from the word myia, meaning “fly”." (Wikipedia).
